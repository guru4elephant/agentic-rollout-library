  "result": "The makemigrations router.allow_migrate() issue occurs because the consistency checking code incorrectly calls allow_migrate() for each app with ALL models in the project instead of just the app's own models.\n\nThe fix should be implemented in the migration consistency checking code (likely in /testbed/django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py or related files). The solution involves:\n\n1. Finding where router.allow_migrate() is called during consistency checks\n2. Replacing the iteration through all models with iteration through app_config.get_models() for each app\n3. Ensuring allow_migrate() is only called with valid (app_label, model) pairs where the model belongs to the app\n\nThis will fix the issue where routers receive invalid model combinations and break sharding implementations that expect proper app-model relationships."
