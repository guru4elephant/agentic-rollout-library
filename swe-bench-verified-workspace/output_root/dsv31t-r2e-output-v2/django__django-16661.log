<<<Finished>>>
Final result: I have successfully fixed the issue with ModelAdmin.lookup_allowed() incorrectly raising DisallowedModelAdminLookup for lookups with foreign keys as primary keys.

**The Problem:**
The issue was in `/testbed/django/contrib/admin/options.py` in the `lookup_allowed` method (around lines 1165-1175). When encountering a one-to-one field that's also a primary key (like `restaurant.place` in the test case), the code incorrectly assumed it was a parent link for concrete inheritance and tried to shortcut the lookup. This caused valid lookups like `restaurant__place__country` to be incorrectly rejected.

**The Fix:**
I modified the logic to properly distinguish between actual concrete inheritance relationships and regular one-to-one fields that happen to be primary keys.

**Before:**
```python
# If this is a primary key and a parent link, it's an inherited field
# from the parent model, and should not be included in the lookup.
if rel.primary_key and rel.one_to_one:
    # Check if the model has any multi-table inheritance ancestors
    if any(parent._meta.abstract for parent in model._meta.get_parent_list()):
        # Abstract inheritance - follow the link
        model = rel.related_model
    else:
        # Concrete inheritance - skip to the next part
        continue
```

**After:**
```python
# If this is a primary key and a parent link, it's an inherited field
# from the parent model, and should not be included in the lookup.
if rel.primary_key and rel.one_to_one:
    # Check if this is actually a parent link for concrete inheritance
    # by verifying that the related model is in the parent chain
    if model._meta.parents and rel.related_model in [parent for parent, _ in model._meta.parents.items()]:
        # Concrete inheritance - skip to the next part
        continue
    else:
        # Not a parent link, follow the relationship
        model = rel.related_model
```

**Key Changes:**
1. Instead of checking for abstract parents in the inheritance chain, we now check if the related model is actually a parent of the current model
2. This correctly identifies when a one-to-one primary key is actually an inheritance relationship vs. just a regular foreign key relationship

**Testing:**
I created comprehensive tests that verify:
- The original failing test case now passes (restaurant__place__country lookup)
- Actual concrete inheritance scenarios continue to work correctly (employee__name lookup through inheritance)
- Disallowed lookups are still properly blocked
- Multiple inheritance scenarios work correctly

The fix is minimal, targeted, and maintains backward compatibility while resolving the specific issue described in the GitHub issue.
