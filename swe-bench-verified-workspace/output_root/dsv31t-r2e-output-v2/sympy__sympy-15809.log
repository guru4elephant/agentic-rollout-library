Final result: Successfully implemented the fix for Zero-argument Min() and Max() functions. The changes were made to `/testbed/sympy/functions/elementary/miscellaneous.py` in the `__new__` method of both Min and Max classes:

- When no arguments are provided, Min() now returns `oo` (positive infinity)
- When no arguments are provided, Max() now returns `-oo` (negative infinity)
- All existing functionality with arguments remains unchanged

This follows the mathematical convention where the minimum of an empty set is positive infinity and the maximum of an empty set is negative infinity, as referenced in the GitHub issue. The fix has been thoroughly tested and works correctly.
