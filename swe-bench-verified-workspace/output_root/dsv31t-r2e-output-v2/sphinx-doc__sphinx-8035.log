   Emitted when the environment determines which source files have changed and

   that the environment has determined.  You can return a list of docnames to
   re-read in addition to these.

.. event:: env-purge-doc (app, env, docname)

   Emitted when all traces of a source file should be cleaned from the
   environment, that is, if the source file is removed or before it is freshly
   read.  This is for extensions that keep their own caches in attributes of the
   environment.

   For example, there is a cache of all modules on the environment.  When a
   source file has been changed, the cache's entries for the file are cleared,
   since the module declarations could have been removed from the file.

.. event:: env-before-read-docs (app, env, docnames)

   Emitted after the environment has determined the list of all added and
   changed files and just before it reads them.  It allows extension authors to
   reorder the list of docnames (*inplace*) before processing, or add more
   docnames that Sphinx did not consider changed (but never add any docnames
   that are not in ``env.found_docs``).

   You can also remove document names; do this with caution since it will make
   Sphinx treat changed files as unchanged.

.. event:: source-read (app, docname, source)

   Emitted when a source file has been read.  The *source* argument is a list
   whose single element is the contents of the source file.  You can process the
   contents and replace this item to implement source-level transformations.

   For example, if you want to use ``$`` signs to delimit inline math, like in

.. event:: missing-reference (app, env, node, contnode)

   Emitted when a cross-reference to an object cannot be resolved.
   If the event handler can resolve the reference, it should return a
   new docutils node to be inserted in the document tree in place of the node
   *node*.  Usually this node is a :class:`reference` node containing *contnode*
   as a child.
   If the handler can not resolve the cross-reference,
   it can either return ``None`` to let other handlers try,
   or raise :class:`NoUri` to prevent other handlers in trying and suppress
   a warning about this cross-reference being unresolved.

   :param env: The build environment (``app.builder.env``).
   :param node: The :class:`pending_xref` node to be resolved.  Its attributes
      ``reftype``, ``reftarget``, ``modname`` and ``classname`` attributes
      determine the type and target of the reference.
   :param contnode: The node that carries the text and formatting inside the
      future reference and should be a child of the returned reference node.

   add a new file type using source parser extensions.  Please read a document
   of the extension to know which file type the extension supports.

   The value may also be a list of file extensions: then Sphinx will consider

      targets, the first target name is the only one which is tested against
      the ``'builders'`` entry and it decides for all.  Also, a ``make text``
      following ``make html`` needs to be issued in the form ``make text
      O="-E"`` to force re-parsing of source files, as the cached ones are
      already transformed.  On the other hand the issue does not arise with
      direct usage of :program:`sphinx-build` as it caches
      (in its default usage) the parsed source files in per builder locations.

   .. hint:: An alternative way to effectively deactivate (or customize) the
      smart quotes for a given builder, for example ``latex``, is to use
      ``make`` this way:

      .. code-block:: console

         make latex O="-D smartquotes_action="

      This can follow some ``make html`` with no problem, in contrast to the
      situation from the prior note.  It requires Docutils 0.14 or later.

.. confval:: html_sidebars

   Custom sidebar templates, must be a dictionary that maps document names to
   template names.

   The keys can contain glob-style patterns [1]_, in which case all matching
   documents will get the specified sidebars.  (A warning is emitted when a
   more than one glob-style pattern matches for any document.)

   The values can be either lists or single strings.

   * If a value is a list, it specifies the complete list of sidebar templates
     to include.  If all or some of the default sidebars are to be included,
     they must be put into this list as well.

     The default sidebars (for documents that don't match any pattern) are
     defined by theme itself.  Builtin themes are using these templates by
     default: ``['localtoc.html', 'relations.html', 'sourcelink.html',
     'searchbox.html']``.

   * If a value is a single string, it specifies a custom sidebar to be added
     between the ``'sourcelink.html'`` and ``'searchbox.html'`` entries.  This
     is for compatibility with Sphinx versions before 1.0.

   .. deprecated:: 1.7

      a single string value for ``html_sidebars`` will be removed in 2.0

   Builtin sidebar templates that can be rendered are:

   * **localtoc.html** -- a fine-grained table of contents of the current
     document
   * **globaltoc.html** -- a coarse-grained table of contents for the whole
     documentation set, collapsed
   * **relations.html** -- two links to the previous and next documents
   * **sourcelink.html** -- a link to the source of the current document, if
     enabled in :confval:`html_show_sourcelink`
   * **searchbox.html** -- the "quick search" box

   Example::

      html_sidebars = {
         '**': ['globaltoc.html', 'sourcelink.html', 'searchbox.html'],
         'using/windows': ['windowssidebar.html', 'searchbox.html'],
      }

   This will render the custom template ``windowssidebar.html`` and the quick
   search box within the sidebar of the given document, and render the default
   sidebars for all other pages (except that the local TOC is replaced by the
   global TOC).

.. confval:: html_search_options

   A dictionary with options for the search language support, empty by default.
   The meaning of these options depends on the language selected.

   The English support has no options.

   The Japanese support has these options:

   :type:
      _`type` is dotted module path string to specify Splitter implementation
      which should be derived from :class:`sphinx.search.ja.BaseSplitter`.  If
      not specified or None is specified,
      ``'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter'`` will be used.

      You can choose from these modules:

      :'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter':
         TinySegmenter algorithm. This is default splitter.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.MecabSplitter':
         MeCab binding. To use this splitter, 'mecab' python binding or dynamic
         link library ('libmecab.so' for linux, 'libmecab.dll' for windows) is
         required.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.JanomeSplitter':
         Janome binding. To use this splitter,
         `Janome <https://pypi.org/project/Janome/>`_ is required.

      .. deprecated:: 1.6
         ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` is deprecated.
         To keep compatibility, ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` are
         also acceptable.

   Other option values depend on splitter value which you choose.

   Options for ``'mecab'``:
      :dic_enc:
         _`dic_enc option` is the encoding for the MeCab algorithm.
      :dict:
         _`dict option` is the dictionary to use for the MeCab algorithm.
      :lib:
         _`lib option` is the library name for finding the MeCab library via
         ctypes if the Python binding is not installed.

      For example::

          html_search_options = {
              'type': 'mecab',
              'dic_enc': 'utf-8',
              'dict': '/path/to/mecab.dic',
              'lib': '/path/to/libmecab.so',
          }

   Options for ``'janome'``:
      :user_dic:
         _`user_dic option` is the user dictionary file path for Janome.
      :user_dic_enc:
         _`user_dic_enc option` is the encoding for the user dictionary file
         specified by ``user_dic`` option. Default is 'utf8'.

      see the discussion of the :confval:`latex_elements` ``'fontenc'`` key.

   If your project uses Unicode characters, setting the engine to

   *startdocname*
     String that specifies the :term:`document name` of the LaTeX file's master
     document.  All documents referenced by the *startdoc* document in TOC trees
     will be included in the LaTeX file.  (If you want to use the default master
     document for your LaTeX build, provide your :confval:`master_doc` here.)

   *targetname*
     File name of the LaTeX file in the output directory.

   *title*
     LaTeX document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  This is inserted as LaTeX markup, so special characters like a
     backslash or ampersand must be represented by the proper LaTeX commands if
     they are to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the LaTeX document.  The same LaTeX markup caveat as for *title*
     applies.  Use ``\\and`` to separate multiple authors, as in:
     ``'John \\and Sarah'`` (backslashes must be Python-escaped to reach LaTeX).

   *theme*
     LaTeX theme.  See :confval:`latex_theme`.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document

.. confval:: latex_use_xindy

   If ``True``, the PDF build from the LaTeX files created by Sphinx
   will use :program:`xindy` (doc__) rather than :program:`makeindex`
   for preparing the index of general terms (from :rst:dir:`index`
   usage).  This means that words with UTF-8 characters will get
   ordered correctly for the :confval:`language`.

   __ http://xindy.sourceforge.net/

   - This option is ignored if :confval:`latex_engine` is ``'platex'``
     (Japanese documents; :program:`mendex` replaces :program:`makeindex`
     then).

   - The default is ``True`` for ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` as
     :program:`makeindex`, if any indexed term starts with a non-ascii
     character, creates ``.ind`` files containing invalid bytes for
     UTF-8 encoding. With ``'lualatex'`` this then breaks the PDF
     build.

   - The default is ``False`` for ``'pdflatex'`` but ``True`` is
     recommended for non-English documents as soon as some indexed
     terms use non-ascii characters from the language script.

   Sphinx adds to :program:`xindy` base distribution some dedicated support
   for using ``'pdflatex'`` engine with Cyrillic scripts.  And whether with
   ``'pdflatex'`` or Unicode engines, Cyrillic documents handle correctly the
   indexing of Latin names, even with diacritics.

   *startdocname*
     String that specifies the :term:`document name` of the the Texinfo file's
     master document.  All documents referenced by the *startdoc* document in
     TOC trees will be included in the Texinfo file.  (If you want to use the
     default master document for your Texinfo build, provide your
     :confval:`master_doc` here.)

   *targetname*
     File name (no extension) of the Texinfo file in the output directory.

   *title*
     Texinfo document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  Inserted as Texinfo markup, so special characters like ``@`` and
     ``{}`` will need to be escaped to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the Texinfo document.  Inserted as Texinfo markup.  Use ``@*``
     to separate multiple authors, as in: ``'John@*Sarah'``.

   *dir_entry*
     The name that will appear in the top-level ``DIR`` menu file.

   *description*
     Descriptive text to appear in the top-level ``DIR`` menu file.

   *category*
     Specifies the section which this entry will appear in the top-level
     ``DIR`` menu file.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document
     that shows up in the HTML, but not the Texinfo output.

.. event:: autodoc-skip-member (app, what, name, obj, skip, options)

   .. versionadded:: 0.5

   Emitted when autodoc has to decide whether a member should be included in the
   documentation.  The member is excluded if a handler returns ``True``.  It is
   included if the handler returns ``False``.

   If more than one enabled extension handles the ``autodoc-skip-member``
   event, autodoc will use the first non-``None`` value returned by a handler.
   Handlers should return ``None`` to fall back to the skipping behavior of
   autodoc and other enabled extensions.

   :param app: the Sphinx application object
   :param what: the type of the object which the docstring belongs to (one of
      ``"module"``, ``"class"``, ``"exception"``, ``"function"``, ``"method"``,
      ``"attribute"``)

   :param obj: the object itself

   If this is a nonempty string (the default is ``'default'``), standard reST
   doctest blocks will be tested too.  They will be assigned to the group name
   given.

   reST doctest blocks are simply doctests put into a paragraph of their own,
   like so::

      Some documentation text.

      >>> print(1)
      1

      Some more documentation text.

   (Note that no special ``::`` is used to introduce a doctest block; docutils
   recognizes them from the leading ``>>>``.  Also, no additional indentation is
   used, though it doesn't hurt.)

   If this value is left at its default value, the above snippet is interpreted
   by the doctest builder exactly like the following::

      Some documentation text.

      .. doctest::

         >>> print(1)
         1

      Some more documentation text.

   This feature makes it easy for you to test doctests in docstrings included
   with the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension without marking them up with a
   special directive.

   Note though that you can't have blank lines in reST doctest blocks.  They
   will be interpreted as one block ending and another one starting.  Also,
   removal of ``<BLANKLINE>`` and ``# doctest:`` options only works in
   :rst:dir:`doctest` blocks, though you may set :confval:`trim_doctest_flags`
   to achieve that in all code blocks with Python console content.[39;49;00m
[31m/testbed/doc/usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:23: WARNING: Unknown directive type "confval".

.. confval:: extlinks

   This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique
   short alias names to a base URL and a *prefix*.  For example, to create an
   alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add ::

      extlinks = {'issue': ('https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/%s',
                            'issue ')}

   Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  This
   then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123.
   As you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the base URL
   in the place of ``%s``.

   The link *caption* depends on the second item in the tuple, the *prefix*:

   - If the prefix is ``None``, the link caption is the full URL.
   - If the prefix is the empty string, the link caption is the partial URL
     given in the role content (``123`` in this case.)
   - If the prefix is a non-empty string, the link caption is the partial URL,
     prepended by the prefix -- in the above example, the link caption would be
     ``issue 123``.

   You can also use the usual "explicit title" syntax supported by other roles
   that generate links, i.e. ``:issue:`this issue <123>```.  In this case, the
   *prefix* is not relevant.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: intersphinx_mapping

   This config value contains the locations and names of other projects that
   should be linked to in this documentation.

   Relative local paths for target locations are taken as relative to the base
   of the built documentation, while relative local paths for inventory
   locations are taken as relative to the source directory.

   When fetching remote inventory files, proxy settings will be read from
   the ``$HTTP_PROXY`` environment variable.

   **Old format for this config value**

   This is the format used before Sphinx 1.0.  It is still recognized.

   A dictionary mapping URIs to either ``None`` or an URI.  The keys are the
   base URI of the foreign Sphinx documentation sets and can be local paths or
   HTTP URIs.  The values indicate where the inventory file can be found: they
   can be ``None`` (at the same location as the base URI) or another local or
   HTTP URI.

   **New format for this config value**

   .. versionadded:: 1.0

   A dictionary mapping unique identifiers to a tuple ``(target, inventory)``.
   Each ``target`` is the base URI of a foreign Sphinx documentation set and can
   be a local path or an HTTP URI.  The ``inventory`` indicates where the
   inventory file can be found: it can be ``None`` (at the same location as
   the base URI) or another local or HTTP URI.

   The unique identifier can be used to prefix cross-reference targets, so that
   it is clear which intersphinx set the target belongs to.  A link like
   ``:ref:`comparison manual <python:comparisons>``` will link to the label
   "comparisons" in the doc set "python", if it exists.

   **Example**

   To add links to modules and objects in the Python standard library
   documentation, use::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3', None)}

   This will download the corresponding :file:`objects.inv` file from the
   Internet and generate links to the pages under the given URI.  The downloaded
   inventory is cached in the Sphinx environment, so it must be re-downloaded
   whenever you do a full rebuild.

   A second example, showing the meaning of a non-``None`` value of the second
   tuple item::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3',
                                        'python-inv.txt')}

   This will read the inventory from :file:`python-inv.txt` in the source
   directory, but still generate links to the pages under
   ``https://docs.python.org/3``.  It is up to you to update the inventory file
   as new objects are added to the Python documentation.

   **Multiple target for the inventory**

   .. versionadded:: 1.3

   Alternative files can be specified for each inventory. One can give a
   tuple for the second inventory tuple item as shown in the following
   example. This will read the inventory iterating through the (second)
   tuple items until the first successful fetch. The primary use case for
   this to specify mirror sites for server downtime of the primary
   inventory::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3',

   ``'png'`` or ``'svg'``. The image is produced by first executing ``latex``
   on the TeX mathematical mark-up then (depending on the requested format)
   either `dvipng`_ or `dvisvgm`_.[39;49;00m
[31m/testbed/doc/usage/extensions/math.rst:43: WARNING: Unknown directive type "confval".

.. confval:: imgmath_use_preview

   ``dvipng`` and ``dvisvgm`` both have the ability to collect from LaTeX the
   "depth" of the rendered math: an inline image should use this "depth" in a
   ``vertical-align`` style to get correctly aligned with surrounding text.

   This mechanism requires the `LaTeX preview package`_ (available as
   ``preview-latex-style`` on Ubuntu xenial).  Therefore, the default for this
   option is ``False`` but it is strongly recommended to set it to ``True``.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2

      This option can be used with the ``'svg'`` :confval:`imgmath_image_format`.[39;49;00m

   The command name with which to invoke LaTeX.  The default is ``'latex'``; you
   may need to set this to a full path if ``latex`` is not in the executable
   search path.

   Since this setting is not portable from system to system, it is normally not
   useful to set it in ``conf.py``; rather, giving it on the
   :program:`sphinx-build` command line via the :option:`-D <sphinx-build -D>`
   option should be preferable, like this::

      sphinx-build -b html -D imgmath_latex=C:\tex\latex.exe . _build/html

   This value should only contain the path to the latex executable, not further
   arguments; use :confval:`imgmath_latex_args` for that purpose.

      Some fancy LaTeX mark-up (an example was reported which used TikZ to add
      various decorations to the equation) require multiple runs of the LaTeX
      executable.  To handle this, set this configuration setting to

   Emitted when all traces of a source file should be cleaned from the
   environment, that is, if the source file is removed or before it is freshly
   read.  This is for extensions that keep their own caches in attributes of the
   environment.

   For example, there is a cache of all modules on the environment.  When a
   source file has been changed, the cache's entries for the file are cleared,
   since the module declarations could have been removed from the file.

   docnames that Sphinx did not consider changed (but never add any docnames

   For example, if you want to use ``$`` signs to delimit inline math, like in

   Emitted when a cross-reference to an object cannot be resolved.
   If the event handler can resolve the reference, it should return a

   *node*.  Usually this node is a :class:`reference` node containing *contnode*

   it can either return ``None`` to let other handlers try,

   a warning about this cross-reference being unresolved.

   :param env: The build environment (``app.builder.env``).
   :param node: The :class:`pending_xref` node to be resolved.  Its attributes
      ``reftype``, ``reftarget``, ``modname`` and ``classname`` attributes

.. confval:: extensions

   A list of strings that are module names of :doc:`extensions

   Note that you can extend :data:`sys.path` within the conf file if your
   extensions live in another directory -- but make sure you use absolute paths.
   If your extension path is relative to the :term:`configuration directory`,
   use :func:`os.path.abspath` like so::

      import sys, os

      sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('sphinxext'))

      extensions = ['extname']

   That way, you can load an extension called ``extname`` from the subdirectory
   ``sphinxext``.

   The configuration file itself can be an extension; for that, you only need
   to provide a :func:`setup` function in it.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: source_suffix

   The file extensions of source files.  Sphinx considers the files with this

          '.rst': 'restructuredtext',
          '.txt': 'restructuredtext',
          '.md': 'markdown',

   By default, Sphinx only supports ``'restructuredtext'`` file type.  You can
   add a new file type using source parser extensions.  Please read a document
   of the extension to know which file type the extension supports.

   The value may also be a list of file extensions: then Sphinx will consider
   that they all map to the ``'restructuredtext'`` file type.

   Default is ``{'.rst': 'restructuredtext'}``.

   This is a ``dict`` whose default is::

   Each entry gives a sufficient condition to ignore the

   Accepted keys are as above ``'builders'`` or ``'languages'``.
   The values are lists.

   .. note:: Currently, in case of invocation of :program:`make` with multiple
      targets, the first target name is the only one which is tested against
      the ``'builders'`` entry and it decides for all.  Also, a ``make text``
      following ``make html`` needs to be issued in the form ``make text
      O="-E"`` to force re-parsing of source files, as the cached ones are
      already transformed.  On the other hand the issue does not arise with
      direct usage of :program:`sphinx-build` as it caches
      (in its default usage) the parsed source files in per builder locations.

   .. hint:: An alternative way to effectively deactivate (or customize) the
      smart quotes for a given builder, for example ``latex``, is to use
      ``make`` this way:

.. confval:: figure_language_filename

   The filename format for language-specific figures.  The default value is
   ``{root}.{language}{ext}``.  It will be expanded to
   ``dirname/filename.en.png`` from ``.. image:: dirname/filename.png``.
   The available format tokens are:

   * ``{root}`` - the filename, including any path component, without the file
     extension, e.g. ``dirname/filename``
   * ``{path}`` - the directory path component of the filename, with a trailing
     slash if non-empty, e.g. ``dirname/``
   * ``{basename}`` - the filename without the directory path or file extension
     components, e.g. ``filename``
   * ``{ext}`` - the file extension, e.g. ``.png``
   * ``{language}`` - the translation language, e.g. ``en``

   For example, setting this to ``{path}{language}/{basename}{ext}`` will
   expand to ``dirname/en/filename.png`` instead.

.. confval:: html_sidebars

   Custom sidebar templates, must be a dictionary that maps document names to
   template names.

   The keys can contain glob-style patterns [1]_, in which case all matching
   documents will get the specified sidebars.  (A warning is emitted when a
   more than one glob-style pattern matches for any document.)

   The values can be either lists or single strings.

   * If a value is a list, it specifies the complete list of sidebar templates
     to include.  If all or some of the default sidebars are to be included,
     they must be put into this list as well.

     The default sidebars (for documents that don't match any pattern) are
     defined by theme itself.  Builtin themes are using these templates by
     default: ``['localtoc.html', 'relations.html', 'sourcelink.html',
     'searchbox.html']``.

   * If a value is a single string, it specifies a custom sidebar to be added
     between the ``'sourcelink.html'`` and ``'searchbox.html'`` entries.  This
     is for compatibility with Sphinx versions before 1.0.

   .. deprecated:: 1.7

      a single string value for ``html_sidebars`` will be removed in 2.0

   Builtin sidebar templates that can be rendered are:

   * **localtoc.html** -- a fine-grained table of contents of the current
     document
   * **globaltoc.html** -- a coarse-grained table of contents for the whole
     documentation set, collapsed
   * **relations.html** -- two links to the previous and next documents
   * **sourcelink.html** -- a link to the source of the current document, if
     enabled in :confval:`html_show_sourcelink`
   * **searchbox.html** -- the "quick search" box

   Example::

      html_sidebars = {
         '**': ['globaltoc.html', 'sourcelink.html', 'searchbox.html'],
         'using/windows': ['windowssidebar.html', 'searchbox.html'],
      }

   This will render the custom template ``windowssidebar.html`` and the quick
   search box within the sidebar of the given document, and render the default
   sidebars for all other pages (except that the local TOC is replaced by the
   global TOC).

   The Japanese support has these options:

   :type:
      _`type` is dotted module path string to specify Splitter implementation
      which should be derived from :class:`sphinx.search.ja.BaseSplitter`.  If
      not specified or None is specified,
      ``'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter'`` will be used.

      You can choose from these modules:

      :'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter':
         TinySegmenter algorithm. This is default splitter.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.MecabSplitter':
         MeCab binding. To use this splitter, 'mecab' python binding or dynamic
         link library ('libmecab.so' for linux, 'libmecab.dll' for windows) is
         required.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.JanomeSplitter':
         Janome binding. To use this splitter,
         `Janome <https://pypi.org/project/Janome/>`_ is required.

      .. deprecated:: 1.6
         ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` is deprecated.
         To keep compatibility, ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` are
         also acceptable.

   Other option values depend on splitter value which you choose.

   Options for ``'mecab'``:
      :dic_enc:
         _`dic_enc option` is the encoding for the MeCab algorithm.
      :dict:
         _`dict option` is the dictionary to use for the MeCab algorithm.
      :lib:
         _`lib option` is the library name for finding the MeCab library via
         ctypes if the Python binding is not installed.

      For example::

          html_search_options = {
              'type': 'mecab',
              'dic_enc': 'utf-8',

              'lib': '/path/to/libmecab.so',
          }

   Options for ``'janome'``:
      :user_dic:
         _`user_dic option` is the user dictionary file path for Janome.
      :user_dic_enc:
         _`user_dic_enc option` is the encoding for the user dictionary file

     LaTeX document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  This is inserted as LaTeX markup, so special characters like a
     backslash or ampersand must be represented by the proper LaTeX commands if
     they are to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the LaTeX document.  The same LaTeX markup caveat as for *title*
     applies.  Use ``\\and`` to separate multiple authors, as in:
     ``'John \\and Sarah'`` (backslashes must be Python-escaped to reach LaTeX).

   *theme*
     LaTeX theme.  See :confval:`latex_theme`.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document
     that shows up in the HTML, but not the LaTeX output.

.. confval:: latex_use_xindy

   If ``True``, the PDF build from the LaTeX files created by Sphinx
   will use :program:`xindy` (doc__) rather than :program:`makeindex`
   for preparing the index of general terms (from :rst:dir:`index`
   usage).  This means that words with UTF-8 characters will get
   ordered correctly for the :confval:`language`.

   __ http://xindy.sourceforge.net/

   - This option is ignored if :confval:`latex_engine` is ``'platex'``
     (Japanese documents; :program:`mendex` replaces :program:`makeindex`
     then).

   - The default is ``True`` for ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` as
     :program:`makeindex`, if any indexed term starts with a non-ascii
     character, creates ``.ind`` files containing invalid bytes for
     UTF-8 encoding. With ``'lualatex'`` this then breaks the PDF
     build.

   - The default is ``False`` for ``'pdflatex'`` but ``True`` is
     recommended for non-English documents as soon as some indexed
     terms use non-ascii characters from the language script.

   Sphinx adds to :program:`xindy` base distribution some dedicated support
   for using ``'pdflatex'`` engine with Cyrillic scripts.  And whether with
   ``'pdflatex'`` or Unicode engines, Cyrillic documents handle correctly the
   indexing of Latin names, even with diacritics.

   Functions imported from C modules cannot be introspected, and therefore the

   is an often-used convention to put the signature into the first line of the
   function's docstring.

   If this boolean value is set to ``True`` (which is the default), autodoc will
   look at the first line of the docstring for functions and methods, and if it
   looks like a signature, use the line as the signature and remove it from the

   multiple signatures and look at the next line of the docstring.  It is useful
   for overloaded function.

   If this is a nonempty string (the default is ``'default'``), standard reST
   doctest blocks will be tested too.  They will be assigned to the group name
   given.

   reST doctest blocks are simply doctests put into a paragraph of their own,
   like so::

      Some documentation text.

      >>> print(1)
      1

      Some more documentation text.

   (Note that no special ``::`` is used to introduce a doctest block; docutils
   recognizes them from the leading ``>>>``.  Also, no additional indentation is
   used, though it doesn't hurt.)

   If this value is left at its default value, the above snippet is interpreted
   by the doctest builder exactly like the following::

      Some documentation text.

      .. doctest::

         >>> print(1)
         1

      Some more documentation text.

   This feature makes it easy for you to test doctests in docstrings included
   with the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension without marking them up with a
   special directive.

   Note though that you can't have blank lines in reST doctest blocks.  They
   will be interpreted as one block ending and another one starting.  Also,
   removal of ``<BLANKLINE>`` and ``# doctest:`` options only works in
   :rst:dir:`doctest` blocks, though you may set :confval:`trim_doctest_flags`
   to achieve that in all code blocks with Python console content.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: extlinks

   This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique
   short alias names to a base URL and a *prefix*.  For example, to create an
   alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add ::

      extlinks = {'issue': ('https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/%s',
                            'issue ')}

   Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  This
   then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123.
   As you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the base URL
   in the place of ``%s``.

   The link *caption* depends on the second item in the tuple, the *prefix*:

   - If the prefix is ``None``, the link caption is the full URL.
   - If the prefix is the empty string, the link caption is the partial URL
     given in the role content (``123`` in this case.)
   - If the prefix is a non-empty string, the link caption is the partial URL,
     prepended by the prefix -- in the above example, the link caption would be
     ``issue 123``.

   You can also use the usual "explicit title" syntax supported by other roles
   that generate links, i.e. ``:issue:`this issue <123>```.  In this case, the
   *prefix* is not relevant.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: intersphinx_mapping

   This config value contains the locations and names of other projects that
   should be linked to in this documentation.

   Relative local paths for target locations are taken as relative to the base
   of the built documentation, while relative local paths for inventory
   locations are taken as relative to the source directory.

   When fetching remote inventory files, proxy settings will be read from
   the ``$HTTP_PROXY`` environment variable.

   **Old format for this config value**

   This is the format used before Sphinx 1.0.  It is still recognized.

   A dictionary mapping URIs to either ``None`` or an URI.  The keys are the
   base URI of the foreign Sphinx documentation sets and can be local paths or
   HTTP URIs.  The values indicate where the inventory file can be found: they
   can be ``None`` (at the same location as the base URI) or another local or
   HTTP URI.

   **New format for this config value**

   .. versionadded:: 1.0

   A dictionary mapping unique identifiers to a tuple ``(target, inventory)``.
   Each ``target`` is the base URI of a foreign Sphinx documentation set and can
   be a local path or an HTTP URI.  The ``inventory`` indicates where the
   inventory file can be found: it can be ``None`` (at the same location as
   the base URI) or another local or HTTP URI.

   The unique identifier can be used to prefix cross-reference targets, so that
   it is clear which intersphinx set the target belongs to.  A link like
   ``:ref:`comparison manual <python:comparisons>``` will link to the label
   "comparisons" in the doc set "python", if it exists.

   **Example**

   To add links to modules and objects in the Python standard library
   documentation, use::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3', None)}

   This will download the corresponding :file:`objects.inv` file from the
   Internet and generate links to the pages under the given URI.  The downloaded
   inventory is cached in the Sphinx environment, so it must be re-downloaded
   whenever you do a full rebuild.

   A second example, showing the meaning of a non-``None`` value of the second
   tuple item::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3',
                                        'python-inv.txt')}

   This will read the inventory from :file:`python-inv.txt` in the source
   directory, but still generate links to the pages under
   ``https://docs.python.org/3``.  It is up to you to update the inventory file
   as new objects are added to the Python documentation.

   **Multiple target for the inventory**

   .. versionadded:: 1.3

   Alternative files can be specified for each inventory. One can give a
   tuple for the second inventory tuple item as shown in the following
   example. This will read the inventory iterating through the (second)
   tuple items until the first successful fetch. The primary use case for
   this to specify mirror sites for server downtime of the primary
   inventory::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3',
                                        (None, 'python-inv.txt'))}[39;49;00m

   This is a function ``linkcode_resolve(domain, info)``,

   the object in given domain with given information.

   The function should return ``None`` if no link is to be added.

   The argument ``domain`` specifies the language domain the object is

   True to use a ``:keyword:`` role for each function keyword argument.
   False to use a single ``:keyword arguments:`` role for all the
   keywords.
   *Defaults to True.*

   This behaves similarly to  :attr:`napoleon_use_param`. Note unlike docutils,
   ``:keyword:`` and ``:param:`` will not be treated the same way - there will
   be a separate "Keyword Arguments" section, rendered in the same fashion as
