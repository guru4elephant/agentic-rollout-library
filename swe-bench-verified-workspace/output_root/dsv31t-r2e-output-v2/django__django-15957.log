=== Iteration 2/100 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: Let me continue investigating the issue. I need to understand how to detect if a queryset has been sliced and then handle it appropriately in the `get_prefetch_queryset` method.

=== Iteration 4/100 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: I notice that the search found references to `low_mark` in various files. Let me verify that my fix is working correctly and run some additional tests to ensure everything is working as expected.

=== Iteration 5/100 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: I notice the bash execution is failing because it's looking for files in the wrong directory. Let me check the current working directory and recreate the test files in the correct location.
