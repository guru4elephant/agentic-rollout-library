<<<Finished>>>
Final result: Fixed the spurious feature name warning in IsolationForest when contamination != "auto".

**Issue**: When fitting an `IsolationForest` with a pandas DataFrame and a non-default `contamination` parameter, a false warning was generated: "X does not have valid feature names, but IsolationForest was fitted with feature names".

**Root Cause**: In the `_thresholds` method of `sklearn/ensemble/_iforest.py`, when `contamination != "auto"`, the code called `self.decision_function(X)` which internally validates feature names through the public API. This validation was incorrectly warning even when the same DataFrame (with valid feature names) was used during the `fit` method.

**Fix**: Modified the `_thresholds` method to use `self._score_samples(X)` directly instead of `self.decision_function(X)` for computing the offset percentile. This bypasses the feature name validation that was causing the spurious warning while maintaining the exact same functionality.

**Changes Made**:
- File: `/testbed/sklearn/ensemble/_iforest.py`
- Lines: 317-318
- Change: Replaced `self.decision_function(X)` with `self._score_samples(X)` in the percentile calculation for the offset parameter.

The fix is minimal, targeted, and preserves all existing functionality. All tests pass and the original reproduction case now works without warnings.
