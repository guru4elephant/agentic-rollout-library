Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "Fixed the makemigrations router.allow_migrate() issue by ensuring that allow_migrate() is only called with valid (app_label, model_name) pairs.\n\nThe fix was implemented in /testbed/django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py by adding a check to filter models that don't belong to the current app before calling allow_migrate().\n\nSpecifically, in the nested loop structure around lines 224-229, we added:\n```python\nif model_key[0] != app_label:\n    continue\n```\n\nThis ensures that for each app, allow_migrate() is only called with models that actually belong to that app, preventing the invalid combinations that were breaking routers expecting valid app-model pairs."
