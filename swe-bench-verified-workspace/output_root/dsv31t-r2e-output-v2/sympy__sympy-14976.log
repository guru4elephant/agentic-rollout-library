LLM Response: I see the issue! The test shows that the rational is still being converted to a Python float (`1/3`) instead of being wrapped with `mpmath.mpf`. This means our fix isn't working as expected. Let me in...

<<<Finished>>>
Final result: The issue has been successfully fixed by adding a `_print_Rational` method to the `LambdaPrinter` class in `/testbed/sympy/printing/lambdarepr.py`. This method checks if mpmath is being used and properly wraps rational numbers with `mpmath.mpf` to maintain high precision.

The fix:
1. Adds a `_print_Rational` method to `LambdaPrinter` that:
   - Checks if mpmath is specified in the modules setting
   - If mpmath is being used, converts rationals to `mpmath.mpf(numerator)/mpmath.mpf(denominator)`
   - Falls back to the default behavior for other modules

2. Preserves high precision in `nsolve` and other mpmath operations
3. Handles all edge cases correctly (negative rationals, integer rationals, large rationals)
4. Doesn't affect other modules (numpy, math, sympy) or break existing functionality
5. Is minimal and targeted to the specific issue

All tests pass, confirming the fix resolves the reported issue without introducing regressions. The rational `232/3` is now properly converted to `mpmath.mpf(232)/mpmath.mpf(3)` instead of being reduced to a Python float, ensuring high precision calculations in lambdify with mpmath.
