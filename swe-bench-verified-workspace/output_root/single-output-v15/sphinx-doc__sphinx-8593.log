   *node*.  Usually this node is a :class:`reference` node containing *contnode*

   a warning about this cross-reference being unresolved.

   :param env: The build environment (``app.builder.env``).
   :param node: The :class:`pending_xref` node to be resolved.  Its attributes
      ``reftype``, ``reftarget``, ``modname`` and ``classname`` attributes

.. confval:: extensions

   A list of strings that are module names of :doc:`extensions

   ``sphinx.ext.*``) or custom ones.

   Note that you can extend :data:`sys.path` within the conf file if your
   extensions live in another directory -- but make sure you use absolute paths.
   If your extension path is relative to the :term:`configuration directory`,
   use :func:`os.path.abspath` like so::

      import sys, os

      sys.path.append(os.path.abspath('sphinxext'))

      extensions = ['extname']

   That way, you can load an extension called ``extname`` from the subdirectory
   ``sphinxext``.

   The configuration file itself can be an extension; for that, you only need
   to provide a :func:`setup` function in it.[39;49;00m

   The values are lists.

   .. note:: Currently, in case of invocation of :program:`make` with multiple
      targets, the first target name is the only one which is tested against
      the ``'builders'`` entry and it decides for all.  Also, a ``make text``
      following ``make html`` needs to be issued in the form ``make text
      O="-E"`` to force re-parsing of source files, as the cached ones are
      already transformed.  On the other hand the issue does not arise with
      direct usage of :program:`sphinx-build` as it caches
      (in its default usage) the parsed source files in per builder locations.

   .. hint:: An alternative way to effectively deactivate (or customize) the

.. confval:: html_sidebars

   Custom sidebar templates, must be a dictionary that maps document names to
   template names.

   The keys can contain glob-style patterns [1]_, in which case all matching
   documents will get the specified sidebars.  (A warning is emitted when a
   more than one glob-style pattern matches for any document.)

   The values can be either lists or single strings.

   * If a value is a list, it specifies the complete list of sidebar templates
     to include.  If all or some of the default sidebars are to be included,
     they must be put into this list as well.

     The default sidebars (for documents that don't match any pattern) are
     defined by theme itself.  Builtin themes are using these templates by
     default: ``['localtoc.html', 'relations.html', 'sourcelink.html',
     'searchbox.html']``.

   * If a value is a single string, it specifies a custom sidebar to be added
     between the ``'sourcelink.html'`` and ``'searchbox.html'`` entries.  This
     is for compatibility with Sphinx versions before 1.0.

   .. deprecated:: 1.7

      a single string value for ``html_sidebars`` will be removed in 2.0

   Builtin sidebar templates that can be rendered are:

   * **localtoc.html** -- a fine-grained table of contents of the current
     document
   * **globaltoc.html** -- a coarse-grained table of contents for the whole
     documentation set, collapsed
   * **relations.html** -- two links to the previous and next documents
   * **sourcelink.html** -- a link to the source of the current document, if
     enabled in :confval:`html_show_sourcelink`
   * **searchbox.html** -- the "quick search" box

   Example::

      html_sidebars = {

         'using/windows': ['windowssidebar.html', 'searchbox.html'],
      }

   This will render the custom template ``windowssidebar.html`` and the quick
   search box within the sidebar of the given document, and render the default
   sidebars for all other pages (except that the local TOC is replaced by the
   global TOC).

.. confval:: html_search_options

   A dictionary with options for the search language support, empty by default.
   The meaning of these options depends on the language selected.

   The English support has no options.

   The Japanese support has these options:

   :type:
      _`type` is dotted module path string to specify Splitter implementation
      which should be derived from :class:`sphinx.search.ja.BaseSplitter`.  If
      not specified or None is specified,
      ``'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter'`` will be used.

      You can choose from these modules:

      :'sphinx.search.ja.DefaultSplitter':
         TinySegmenter algorithm. This is default splitter.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.MecabSplitter':
         MeCab binding. To use this splitter, 'mecab' python binding or dynamic
         link library ('libmecab.so' for linux, 'libmecab.dll' for windows) is
         required.
      :'sphinx.search.ja.JanomeSplitter':
         Janome binding. To use this splitter,
         `Janome <https://pypi.org/project/Janome/>`_ is required.

      .. deprecated:: 1.6
         ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` is deprecated.
         To keep compatibility, ``'mecab'``, ``'janome'`` and ``'default'`` are
         also acceptable.

   Other option values depend on splitter value which you choose.

   Options for ``'mecab'``:
      :dic_enc:
         _`dic_enc option` is the encoding for the MeCab algorithm.
      :dict:
         _`dict option` is the dictionary to use for the MeCab algorithm.
      :lib:
         _`lib option` is the library name for finding the MeCab library via
         ctypes if the Python binding is not installed.

      For example::

          html_search_options = {
              'type': 'mecab',
              'dic_enc': 'utf-8',
              'dict': '/path/to/mecab.dic',
              'lib': '/path/to/libmecab.so',
          }

   Options for ``'janome'``:
      :user_dic:
         _`user_dic option` is the user dictionary file path for Janome.
      :user_dic_enc:
         _`user_dic_enc option` is the encoding for the user dictionary file
         specified by ``user_dic`` option. Default is 'utf8'.

.. confval:: latex_engine

   The LaTeX engine to build the docs.  The setting can have the following
   values:

   * ``'pdflatex'`` -- PDFLaTeX (default)
   * ``'xelatex'`` -- XeLaTeX
   * ``'lualatex'`` -- LuaLaTeX
   * ``'platex'`` -- pLaTeX (default if :confval:`language` is ``'ja'``)
   * ``'uplatex'`` -- upLaTeX (experimental)

   ``'pdflatex'``\ 's support for Unicode characters is limited.

   .. note::

      2.0 adds to ``'pdflatex'`` support in Latin language document of
      occasional Cyrillic or Greek letters or words.  This is not automatic,
      see the discussion of the :confval:`latex_elements` ``'fontenc'`` key.

   If your project uses Unicode characters, setting the engine to
   ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` and making sure to use an OpenType font
   with wide-enough glyph coverage is often easier than trying to make
   ``'pdflatex'`` work with the extra Unicode characters.  Since Sphinx 2.0
   the default is the GNU FreeFont which covers well Latin, Cyrillic and
   Greek.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.1.0

      Use ``xelatex`` (and LaTeX package ``xeCJK``) by default for Chinese
      documents.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.2.1

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3

      Add ``uplatex`` support.

   Contrarily to :ref:`MathJaX math rendering in HTML output <math-support>`,
   LaTeX requires some extra configuration to support Unicode literals in
   :rst:dir:`math`: the only comprehensive solution (as far as we know) is to
   use ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` *and* to add
   ``r'\usepackage{unicode-math}'`` (e.g. via the :confval:`latex_elements`
   ``'preamble'`` key).  You may prefer
   ``r'\usepackage[math-style=literal]{unicode-math}'`` to keep a Unicode
   literal such as ``α`` (U+03B1) for example as is in output, rather than
   being rendered as :math:`\alpha`.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: latex_documents

   This value determines how to group the document tree into LaTeX source files.
   It must be a list of tuples ``(startdocname, targetname, title, author,
   theme, toctree_only)``, where the items are:

   *startdocname*
     String that specifies the :term:`document name` of the LaTeX file's master
     document.  All documents referenced by the *startdoc* document in TOC trees
     will be included in the LaTeX file.  (If you want to use the default master
     document for your LaTeX build, provide your :confval:`master_doc` here.)

   *targetname*
     File name of the LaTeX file in the output directory.

   *title*
     LaTeX document title.  Can be empty to use the title of the *startdoc*
     document.  This is inserted as LaTeX markup, so special characters like a
     backslash or ampersand must be represented by the proper LaTeX commands if
     they are to be inserted literally.

   *author*
     Author for the LaTeX document.  The same LaTeX markup caveat as for *title*
     applies.  Use ``\\and`` to separate multiple authors, as in:
     ``'John \\and Sarah'`` (backslashes must be Python-escaped to reach LaTeX).

   *theme*
     LaTeX theme.  See :confval:`latex_theme`.

   *toctree_only*
     Must be ``True`` or ``False``.  If true, the *startdoc* document itself is
     not included in the output, only the documents referenced by it via TOC
     trees.  With this option, you can put extra stuff in the master document
     that shows up in the HTML, but not the LaTeX output.

.. confval:: latex_use_xindy

   If ``True``, the PDF build from the LaTeX files created by Sphinx
   will use :program:`xindy` (doc__) rather than :program:`makeindex`
   for preparing the index of general terms (from :rst:dir:`index`
   usage).  This means that words with UTF-8 characters will get
   ordered correctly for the :confval:`language`.

   __ http://xindy.sourceforge.net/

   - This option is ignored if :confval:`latex_engine` is ``'platex'``
     (Japanese documents; :program:`mendex` replaces :program:`makeindex`
     then).

   - The default is ``True`` for ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` as
     :program:`makeindex`, if any indexed term starts with a non-ascii
     character, creates ``.ind`` files containing invalid bytes for
     UTF-8 encoding. With ``'lualatex'`` this then breaks the PDF
     build.

   - The default is ``False`` for ``'pdflatex'`` but ``True`` is
     recommended for non-English documents as soon as some indexed
     terms use non-ascii characters from the language script.

   Sphinx adds to :program:`xindy` base distribution some dedicated support
   for using ``'pdflatex'`` engine with Cyrillic scripts.  And whether with
   ``'pdflatex'`` or Unicode engines, Cyrillic documents handle correctly the
   indexing of Latin names, even with diacritics.

.. confval:: linkcheck_anchors_ignore

   A list of regular expressions that match anchors Sphinx should skip when
   checking the validity of anchors in links. This allows skipping anchors that
   a website's JavaScript adds to control dynamic pages or when triggering an
   internal REST request. Default is ``["^!"]``.

   .. note::

      If you want to ignore anchors of a specific page or of pages that match a
      specific pattern (but still check occurrences of the same page(s) that
      don't have anchors), use :confval:`linkcheck_ignore` instead, for example
      as follows::

         linkcheck_ignore = [

.. confval:: linkcheck_auth

   Pass authentication information when doing a ``linkcheck`` build.

   A list of ``(regex_pattern, auth_info)`` tuples where the items are:

   *regex_pattern*
     A regular expression that matches a URI.
   *auth_info*
     Authentication information to use for that URI. The value can be anything
     that is understood by the ``requests`` library (see `requests
     Authentication <requests-auth>`_ for details).

     .. _requests-auth: https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/user/authentication/

   The ``linkcheck`` builder will use the first matching ``auth_info`` value
   it can find in the :confval:`linkcheck_auth` list, so values earlier in the
   list have higher priority.

   Example::

      linkcheck_auth = [
        ('https://foo\.yourcompany\.com/.+', ('johndoe', 'secret')),
        ('https://.+\.yourcompany\.com/.+', HTTPDigestAuth(...)),

   The ``linkcheck`` builder may issue a large number of requests to the same

   when servers indicate that requests are rate-limited.

   If a server indicates when to retry (using the `Retry-After`_ header),
   ``linkcheck`` always follows the server indication.

   Otherwise, ``linkcheck`` waits for a minute before to retry and keeps
   doubling the wait time between attempts until it succeeds or exceeds the
   ``linkcheck_rate_limit_timeout``. By default, the timeout is 5 minutes.

   Functions imported from C modules cannot be introspected, and therefore the

   is an often-used convention to put the signature into the first line of the

   If this boolean value is set to ``True`` (which is the default), autodoc will
   look at the first line of the docstring for functions and methods, and if it
   looks like a signature, use the line as the signature and remove it from the

   multiple signatures and look at the next line of the docstring.  It is useful
   for overloaded function.

   A dictionary for users defined `type aliases`__ that maps a type name to the

   The type aliases are only available if your program enables `Postponed

     def f() -> AliasType:

   If this is a nonempty string (the default is ``'default'``), standard reST
   doctest blocks will be tested too.  They will be assigned to the group name
   given.

   reST doctest blocks are simply doctests put into a paragraph of their own,
   like so::

      Some documentation text.

      >>> print(1)
      1

      Some more documentation text.

   (Note that no special ``::`` is used to introduce a doctest block; docutils
   recognizes them from the leading ``>>>``.  Also, no additional indentation is
   used, though it doesn't hurt.)

   If this value is left at its default value, the above snippet is interpreted
   by the doctest builder exactly like the following::

      Some documentation text.

      .. doctest::

         >>> print(1)
         1

      Some more documentation text.

   This feature makes it easy for you to test doctests in docstrings included
   with the :mod:`~sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension without marking them up with a
   special directive.

   Note though that you can't have blank lines in reST doctest blocks.  They
   will be interpreted as one block ending and another one starting.  Also,
   removal of ``<BLANKLINE>`` and ``# doctest:`` options only works in
   :rst:dir:`doctest` blocks, though you may set :confval:`trim_doctest_flags`
   to achieve that in all code blocks with Python console content.[39;49;00m
[31m/testbed/doc/usage/extensions/extlinks.rst:23: WARNING: Unknown directive type "confval".

.. confval:: extlinks

   This config value must be a dictionary of external sites, mapping unique
   short alias names to a base URL and a *prefix*.  For example, to create an
   alias for the above mentioned issues, you would add ::

      extlinks = {'issue': ('https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/%s',
                            'issue ')}

   Now, you can use the alias name as a new role, e.g. ``:issue:`123```.  This
   then inserts a link to https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/123.
   As you can see, the target given in the role is substituted in the base URL
   in the place of ``%s``.

   The link *caption* depends on the second item in the tuple, the *prefix*:

   - If the prefix is ``None``, the link caption is the full URL.
   - If the prefix is the empty string, the link caption is the partial URL
     given in the role content (``123`` in this case.)
   - If the prefix is a non-empty string, the link caption is the partial URL,
     prepended by the prefix -- in the above example, the link caption would be
     ``issue 123``.

   You can also use the usual "explicit title" syntax supported by other roles
   that generate links, i.e. ``:issue:`this issue <123>```.  In this case, the
   *prefix* is not relevant.[39;49;00m

.. confval:: intersphinx_mapping

   This config value contains the locations and names of other projects that
   should be linked to in this documentation.

   Relative local paths for target locations are taken as relative to the base
   of the built documentation, while relative local paths for inventory
   locations are taken as relative to the source directory.

   When fetching remote inventory files, proxy settings will be read from
   the ``$HTTP_PROXY`` environment variable.

   **Old format for this config value**

   This is the format used before Sphinx 1.0.  It is still recognized.

   A dictionary mapping URIs to either ``None`` or an URI.  The keys are the
   base URI of the foreign Sphinx documentation sets and can be local paths or
   HTTP URIs.  The values indicate where the inventory file can be found: they
   can be ``None`` (at the same location as the base URI) or another local or
   HTTP URI.

   **New format for this config value**

   .. versionadded:: 1.0

   A dictionary mapping unique identifiers to a tuple ``(target, inventory)``.
   Each ``target`` is the base URI of a foreign Sphinx documentation set and can
   be a local path or an HTTP URI.  The ``inventory`` indicates where the
   inventory file can be found: it can be ``None`` (an :file:`objects.inv` file
   at the same location as the base URI) or another local file path or a full
   HTTP URI to an inventory file.

   The unique identifier can be used to prefix cross-reference targets, so that
   it is clear which intersphinx set the target belongs to.  A link like
   ``:ref:`comparison manual <python:comparisons>``` will link to the label
   "comparisons" in the doc set "python", if it exists.

   **Example**

   To add links to modules and objects in the Python standard library
   documentation, use::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3', None)}

   This will download the corresponding :file:`objects.inv` file from the
   Internet and generate links to the pages under the given URI.  The downloaded
   inventory is cached in the Sphinx environment, so it must be re-downloaded
   whenever you do a full rebuild.

   A second example, showing the meaning of a non-``None`` value of the second
   tuple item::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3',
                                        'python-inv.txt')}

   This will read the inventory from :file:`python-inv.txt` in the source
   directory, but still generate links to the pages under
   ``https://docs.python.org/3``.  It is up to you to update the inventory file
   as new objects are added to the Python documentation.

   **Multiple targets for the inventory**

   .. versionadded:: 1.3

   Alternative files can be specified for each inventory. One can give a
   tuple for the second inventory tuple item as shown in the following
   example. This will read the inventory iterating through the (second)
   tuple items until the first successful fetch. The primary use case for
   this to specify mirror sites for server downtime of the primary
   inventory::

      intersphinx_mapping = {'python': ('https://docs.python.org/3',
                                        (None, 'python-inv.txt'))}

   For a set of books edited and tested locally and then published
   together, it could be helpful to try a local inventory file first,
   to check references before publication::

      intersphinx_mapping = {
          'otherbook':
              ('https://myproj.readthedocs.io/projects/otherbook/en/latest',
