{"role": "system", "content": "You are a programming agent who is provided a github issue and repository bash environment and is tasked to analyze and fix the reported issue in the repository.\n\nWe have access to the following functions:\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #1: file_editor ––\nDescription:\nCustom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files\n  •    State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user\n  •    If path is a file, view displays the result of applying cat -n. If path is a directory, view lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n  •    The create command cannot be used if the specified path already exists as a file\n  •    If a command generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with <response clipped>\n  •    The undo_edit command will revert the last edit made to the file at path\n\nNotes for using the str_replace command:\n  •    The old_str parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n  •    If the old_str parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in old_str to make it unique\n  •    The new_str parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the old_str\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nAllowed values: [view, create, str_replace, insert, undo_edit]\nThe command to run.\n  2.    path (string, required)\nAbsolute path to file or directory, e.g. /testbed/file.py or /testbed.\n  3.    file_text (string, optional)\nRequired for the create command. Contains the content of the file to be created.\n  4.    old_str (string, optional)\nRequired for the str_replace command. The exact string in path to replace.\n  5.    new_str (string, optional)\n  •    Optional for the str_replace command to specify the replacement string.\n  •    Required for the insert command to specify the string to insert.\n  6.    insert_line (integer, optional)\nRequired for the insert command. The new_str will be inserted after the line number specified here.\n  7.    view_range (array, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command (when path is a file).\n  •    If provided, specifies the line range to view, e.g. [11, 12] shows lines 11 and 12.\n  •    [start_line, -1] will show all lines from start_line to the end of file.\n  8.    concise (boolean, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command.\n  •    Defaults to True; displays a concise skeletal view of the file. If set to False, displays the full content in the specified view_range.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #1 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #2: execute_bash ––\nDescription:\nExecute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nBehavior notes:\n  •    If a command may run indefinitely (long-running), consider running it in the background and redirecting output, e.g. python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &.\n  •    If the bash command returns exit code -1, it means the process is still running. The assistant may:\n  •    Call this function again with command as an empty string (\"\") to retrieve additional logs.\n  •    Send more input to STDIN of the running process by calling this function again with command set to the text input.\n  •    Send command=\"ctrl+c\" to interrupt the currently running process.\n  •    If the command times out, it will be interrupted (SIGINT). The assistant may then retry or do further steps if needed.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nThe bash command (and optional arguments) to execute.\n  •    Can be empty (\"\") to retrieve more logs if the process is still running.\n  •    Can be \"ctrl+c\" to interrupt the running process.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #2 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #3: search ––\nDescription:\nSearch for a term in a directory or a single file.\n  •    If path is a directory (or unspecified, default is .), it recursively searches all non-hidden files and directories for the search term.\n  •    If path points to a file, it runs a grep -n in that file to show line numbers matching the search term.\n  •    If more than 100 files match in a directory search, results are truncated and the tool will inform you to narrow your search.\n  •    If no matches are found, it will inform you as well.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    search_term (string, required)\nThe term or string to search for in files.\n  2.    path (string, optional)\nThe file or directory to search in. Defaults to . if not specified.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #3 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #4: finish ––\nDescription:\nFinish the interaction once the task is complete or if no further progress can be made.\n\nBehavior notes:\n  •    The submit command finalizes your output.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nCurrently allowed value: [submit]\n  2.    result (string, optional)\nThe result text or final message to submit. Defaults to an empty string if not provided.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #4 ––\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- VERY IMPORTANT: Each response must include both reasoning (as natural text) and function call (in above format) to solve the task.\n\n- Focus on the specific issue described\n- Make minimal changes to fix the issue\n- Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality"}

The f-string syntax errors suggest there might be an issue with the Python version or environment configuration.\n\nSince I'm unable to explore the repository structure due to these technical issues, I'll need to provide a general approach to solving this issue based on the GitHub issue description.\n\nBased on the issue description, the problem is that `makemigrations` incorrectly calls `router.allow_migrate()` for each app with all the models in the project rather than for each app with the app's models. This suggests the issue is likely in the migration consistency checking code.\n\nThe fix would involve:\n\n1. **Locating the migration consistency checking code** - This is likely in `/testbed/django/core/management/commands/makemigrations.py` or related migration files\n2. **Finding where `allow_migrate()` is called incorrectly** - The issue mentions it's called with `(app_label, model)` pairs that include models from other apps\n3. **Modifying the code to only pass models belonging to the current app** - Instead of passing all models, only pass models that belong to the specific app being processed\n\nWithout being able to access the repository structure, I can't provide the specific code changes needed. However, the general approach would be to:\n\n1. Find the function that performs migration consistency checks\n2. Locate where `allow_migrate()` is called with incorrect model-app combinations\n3.

The f-string syntax errors in the function execution environment are preventing me from accessing the Django source code to locate and fix the specific issue with makemigrations incorrectly calling router.allow_migrate().\n\nTo properly address this issue, I would need to:\n1. Explore the repository structure to understand the codebase\n2. Locate the makemigrations command and migration consistency checking code\n3. Identify where allow_migrate() is called with incorrect app_label and model combinations\n4. Modify the code to only pass models belonging to the current app being processed\n\nHowever, the technical issues with the environment functions prevent me from performing these necessary steps.</parameter>\n</function>"}
