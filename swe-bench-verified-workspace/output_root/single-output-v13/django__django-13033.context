If path is a directory, view lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n  •    The create command cannot be used if the specified path already exists as a file\n  •    If a command generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with <response clipped>\n  •    The undo_edit command will revert the last edit made to the file at path\n\nNotes for using the str_replace command:\n  •    The old_str parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n  •    If the old_str parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in old_str to make it unique\n  •    The new_str parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the old_str\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nAllowed values: [view, create, str_replace, insert, undo_edit]\nThe command to run.\n  2.    path (string, required)\nAbsolute path to file or directory, e.g. /testbed/file.py or /testbed.\n  3.    file_text (string, optional)\nRequired for the create command. Contains the content of the file to be created.\n  4.    old_str (string, optional)\nRequired for the str_replace command. The exact string in path to replace.\n  5.    new_str (string, optional)\n  •    Optional for the str_replace command to specify the replacement string.\n  •    Required for the insert command to specify the string to insert.\n  6.    insert_line (integer, optional)\nRequired for the insert command. The new_str will be inserted after the line number specified here.\n  7.    view_range (array, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command (when path is a file).\n  •    If provided, specifies the line range to view, e.g. [11, 12] shows lines 11 and 12.\n  •    [start_line, -1] will show all lines from start_line to the end of file.\n  8.    concise (boolean, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command.\n  •    Defaults to True; displays a concise skeletal view of the file. If set to False, displays the full content in the specified view_range.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #1 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #2: execute_bash ––\nDescription:\nExecute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nBehavior notes:\n  •    If a command may run indefinitely (long-running), consider running it in the background and redirecting output, e.g. python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &.\n  •    If the bash command returns exit code -1, it means the process is still running. The assistant may:\n  •    Call this function again with command as an empty string (\"\") to retrieve additional logs.\n  •    Send more input to STDIN of the running process by calling this function again with command set to the text input.\n  •    Send command=\"ctrl+c\" to interrupt the currently running process.\n  •    If the command times out, it will be interrupted (SIGINT).

{"role": "user", "content": "Consider the following github issue:\n<github_issue>\nSelf referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation \"_id\" field.\nDescription\n\t\nInitially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:\nclass OneModel(models.Model):\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tordering = (\"-id\",)\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\troot = models.ForeignKey(\"OneModel\", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)\n\toneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nclass TwoModel(models.Model):\n\tid = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)\n\trecord = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n\ttwoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)\nThe following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" DESC\nThe query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.\nNote also that the queryset with order_by(\"record__root\") gives the exact same SQL.\nThis queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"record__root__id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" ASC\nSo is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?\nAnother queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.annotate(root_id=F(\"record__root_id\"))\nqs = qs.order_by(\"root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY \"orion_onemodel\".\"zero_id\" ASC\nASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.\nOne final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():\nqs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])\nqs = qs.order_by(\"-record__root_id\")\nprint(qs.query)\nSELECT \"orion_twomodel\".\"id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\", \"orion_twomodel\".\"twoval\" FROM \"orion_twomodel\" INNER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" ON (\"orion_twomodel\".\"record_id\" = \"orion_onemodel\".\"id\") LEFT OUTER JOIN \"orion_onemodel\" T3 ON (\"orion_onemodel\".\"root_id\" = T3.\"id\") WHERE \"orion_onemodel\".\"oneval\" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3.\"id\" ASC\nOne gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by(\"-record__root_id\") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.\nThanks for any assistance and clarification.\n\n</github_issue>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository to fix the <github_issue>?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <github_issue>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <github_issue> is satisfied.\n\nIMPORTANT TIP:\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script ('reproduce_issue.py') to reproduce the error and execute it to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. When viewing large files, use specific line-ranges, usually within 50 to 100 lines) as required\n7. NOTE: The repository is at '/testbed' and the current working directory is already '/testbed', so DO NOT include 'testbed/' or 'testbed.' in relative paths in bash commands or reproduction python files.\n8. Use pip source http://pip.baidu.com/pypi/simple if you need to install new package with python\n"}
