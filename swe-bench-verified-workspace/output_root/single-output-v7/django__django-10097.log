Calling LLM...
LLM Response: I'll help you implement the necessary changes to fix the URLValidator issue. Let's start by exploring the repository structure to understand the codebase.

LLM Response: Let me try a different approach to explore the repository structure:

=== Iteration 3/100 ===

LLM Response: It seems there's an issue with the bash execution environment. Let me try using the file_editor function to explore the repository structure:

=== Iteration 4/100 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: I notice there seems to be a syntax error in the backend system. Let me try a different approach by directly searching for URLValidator-related files:

=== Iteration 5/100 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: I notice there seems to be a system-wide syntax error affecting all functions. This appears to be an environment issue rather than a problem with my approach. Let me try to work around this by attempt...

Calling LLM...
LLM Response: I'm encountering a system-level syntax error that's preventing me from using any of the available functions. This appears to be an issue with the environment setup where f-string syntax is not being p...
Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "I'm unable to proceed with analyzing and fixing the URLValidator issue due to a system-level environment problem. The backend tools are throwing SyntaxError exceptions related to f-string usage, which suggests the Python environment doesn't support Python 3.6+ features. This prevents me from using any of the available functions (file_editor, execute_bash, search) to explore the repository structure, reproduce the issue, or implement the necessary changes.\n\nTo resolve this, the environment needs to be updated to support Python 3.6+ syntax, or the backend tools need to be modified to use compatible string formatting syntax."

=== Iteration 7/100 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: I can see that the system is experiencing a fundamental syntax error in all backend tools due to the use of f-strings, which suggests the Python environment is older than Python 3.6. Since I cannot us...
