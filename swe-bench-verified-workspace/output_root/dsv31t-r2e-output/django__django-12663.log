Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "Fixed the SimpleLazyObject issue with nested subquery annotations by modifying the `get_prep_lookup` method in `/testbed/django/db/models/lookups.py` to handle SimpleLazyObject instances by resolving them before passing to field's `get_prep_value` method.\n\nThe fix:\n1. Checks if the right-hand side (rhs) of the lookup is a SimpleLazyObject\n2. If so, resolves it by accessing the `_wrapped` attribute or calling `_setup` if needed\n3. Then proceeds with the normal field preparation process\n\nThis ensures that SimpleLazyObject instances are properly resolved before being converted to database values, fixing the TypeError that occurred when trying to convert a SimpleLazyObject to an integer."
