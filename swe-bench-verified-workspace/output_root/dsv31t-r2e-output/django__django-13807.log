Reproduced the original issue with table name \"order\"\n2. Verified the fix resolves the syntax error\n3. Tested with multiple SQL keywords (select, table, where, group, from)\n4. Verified no regression with normal table names\n5. Tested edge cases (empty list, mixed table names)\n\n## Result\nThe issue has been successfully fixed. SQL keyword table names are now properly quoted with backticks in PRAGMA statements, preventing syntax errors during loaddata operations."
