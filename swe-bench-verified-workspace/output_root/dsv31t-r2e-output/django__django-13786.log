Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "The issue has been successfully fixed. The problem was in the `CreateModel.reduce` method in `/testbed/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`. When squashing an `AlterModelOptions` operation into a `CreateModel` operation, the code was simply merging options dictionaries without handling option removal.\n\nThe fix adds logic to properly remove options that exist in the original CreateModel but are not present in the AlterModelOptions operation, mirroring the behavior of `AlterModelOptions.state_forwards()`. This ensures that when `AlterModelOptions` is used with empty or partial options, unwanted options are properly cleared from the resulting squashed operation.\n\nThe changes are minimal and targeted, addressing exactly the issue described while maintaining backward compatibility."
