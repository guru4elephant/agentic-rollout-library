  "result": "The bug in the POSIX implementation of django/core/files/locks.py has been identified. The issue is that the code incorrectly checks the return value of fcntl.flock(), which returns None on success and raises OSError on failure, rather than returning 0.\n\nThe fix involves changing the lock and unlock functions to use try-except blocks:\n\n1. In the lock function:\n   - Wrap fcntl.flock() in a try block\n   - Return True if successful (no exception)\n   - Return False if OSError is caught\n\n2. In the unlock function:\n   - Wrap fcntl.flock() in a try block  \n   - Return True if successful (no exception)\n   - Return False if OSError is caught\n\nThe specific changes needed in /testbed/django/core/files/locks.py are:\n\nReplace:\n```python\n    else:\n        def lock(f, flags):\n            ret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n            return ret == 0\n        def unlock(f):\n            ret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n            return ret == 0\n```\n\nWith:\n```python\n    else:\n        def lock(f, flags):\n            try:\n                fcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\n                return True\n            except OSError:\n                return False\n        def unlock(f):\n            try:\n                fcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\n                return True\n            except OSError:\n                return False\n```\n\nThis fix ensures that non-blocking lock operations (locks.LOCKS_NB) will return a valid boolean value indicating success or failure, which is essential for proper lock acquisition logic."
