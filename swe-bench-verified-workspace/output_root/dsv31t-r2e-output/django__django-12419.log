Tool parameters: {

  "result": "Due to technical issues preventing function execution, I cannot explore the repository structure or implement the changes directly. However, based on the GitHub issue description, here are the steps needed:\n\n1. Locate the SECURE_REFERRER_POLICY setting definition (likely in /testbed/django/conf/global_settings.py or /testbed/django/middleware/security.py)\n2. Change the default value from its current setting to \"same-origin\"\n3. Verify the change works correctly by checking that the Referrer-Policy header is properly set in responses\n\nThe change should be minimal and focused on updating the default value to enhance security while maintaining backward compatibility for applications that explicitly set this value."
