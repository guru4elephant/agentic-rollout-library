If path is a directory, view lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n  •    The create command cannot be used if the specified path already exists as a file\n  •    If a command generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with <response clipped>\n  •    The undo_edit command will revert the last edit made to the file at path\n\nNotes for using the str_replace command:\n  •    The old_str parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n  •    If the old_str parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in old_str to make it unique\n  •    The new_str parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the old_str\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nAllowed values: [view, create, str_replace, insert, undo_edit]\nThe command to run.\n  2.    path (string, required)\nAbsolute path to file or directory, e.g. /testbed/file.py or /testbed.\n  3.    file_text (string, optional)\nRequired for the create command.

The exact string in path to replace.\n  5.    new_str (string, optional)\n  •    Optional for the str_replace command to specify the replacement string.\n  •    Required for the insert command to specify the string to insert.\n  6.    insert_line (integer, optional)\nRequired for the insert command. The new_str will be inserted after the line number specified here.\n  7.    view_range (array, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command (when path is a file).\n  •    If provided, specifies the line range to view, e.g. [11, 12] shows lines 11 and 12.\n  •    [start_line, -1] will show all lines from start_line to the end of file.\n  8.    concise (boolean, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command.\n  •    Defaults to True; displays a concise skeletal view of the file.

The assistant may:\n  •    Call this function again with command as an empty string (\"\") to retrieve additional logs.\n  •    Send more input to STDIN of the running process by calling this function again with command set to the text input.\n  •    Send command=\"ctrl+c\" to interrupt the currently running process.\n  •    If the command times out, it will be interrupted (SIGINT). The assistant may then retry or do further steps if needed.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nThe bash command (and optional arguments) to execute.\n  •    Can be empty (\"\") to retrieve more logs if the process is still running.\n  •    Can be \"ctrl+c\" to interrupt the running process.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #2 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #3: search ––\nDescription:\nSearch for a term in a directory or a single file.\n  •    If path is a directory (or unspecified, default is .), it recursively searches all non-hidden files and directories for the search term.\n  •    If path points to a file, it runs a grep -n in that file to show line numbers matching the search term.\n  •    If more than 100 files match in a directory search, results are truncated and the tool will inform you to narrow your search.\n  •    If no matches are found, it will inform you as well.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    search_term (string, required)\nThe term or string to search for in files.\n  2.    path (string, optional)\nThe file or directory to search in.

{"role": "user", "content": "Consider the following github issue:\n<github_issue>\nChange in behaviour when saving a model instance with an explcit pk value if the pk field has a default\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Reupen Shah)\n\t \nConsider the following model:\nfrom uuid import uuid4\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Sample(models.Model):\n\tid = models.UUIDField(primary_key=True, default=uuid4)\n\tname = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=100)\nIn Django 2.2 and earlier, the following commands would result in an INSERT followed by an UPDATE:\ns0 = Sample.objects.create()\ns1 = Sample(pk=s0.pk, name='Test 1')\ns1.save()\nHowever, in Django 3.0, this results in two INSERTs (naturally the second one fails). The behaviour also changes if default=uuid4 is removed from the id field.\nThis seems related to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29260.\nThe change in behaviour also has the side effect of changing the behaviour of the loaddata management command when the fixture contains explicit pk values and the objects already exist (e.g. when loading the fixture multiple times).\nPerhaps the intention was to only change the behaviour if an explicit pk value was not set on the model instance being saved? (At least, that would be more backwards-compatible behaviour...)\n\n</github_issue>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository to fix the <github_issue>?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <github_issue>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <github_issue> is satisfied.\n\nIMPORTANT TIP:\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script ('reproduce_issue.py') to reproduce the error and execute it to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. When viewing large files, use specific line-ranges, usually within 50 to 100 lines) as required\n7. NOTE: The repository is at '/testbed' and the current working directory is already '/testbed', so DO NOT include 'testbed/' or 'testbed.' in relative paths in bash commands or reproduction python files.\n8. Use pip source http://pip.baidu.com/pypi/simple if you need to install new package with python\n"}
