This is a regression that needs to be fixed.\n\n## Solution\nThe fix must be applied to `django/contrib/admin/options.py` in the `InlineModelAdmin` class. The permission checking methods need to be modified to check permissions on the parent model for auto-created through models.\n\n## Exact Code Changes\n\nIn `django/contrib/admin/options.py`, add this helper method to the `InlineModelAdmin` class:\n\n```python\ndef _get_parent_model_from_through_model(self):\n    \"\"\"\n    Get the parent model from an auto-created through model.\n    Returns None if this is not an auto-created through model.\n    \"\"\"\n    if hasattr(self.model, '_meta') and self.model._meta.auto_created:\n        field = self.model._meta.auto_created\n        if hasattr(field, 'model'):\n            return field.model\n    return None\n```\n\nThen modify the three permission methods:\n\n```python\ndef has_add_permission(self, request, obj=None):\n    from django.contrib.auth import get_permission_codename\n    \n    parent_model = self._get_parent_model_from_through_model()\n    if parent_model:\n        opts = parent_model._meta\n        codename = get_permission_codename('add', opts)\n        return request.user.has_perm(\"%s.%s\" % (opts.app_label, codename))\n    return super().has_add_permission(request, obj)\n\ndef has_change_permission(self, request, obj=None):\n    from django.contrib.auth import get_permission_codename\n    \n    parent_model = self._get_parent_model_from_through_model()\n    if parent_model:\n        opts = parent_model._meta\n        codename = get_permission_codename('change', opts)\n        return request.user.has_perm(\"%s.%s\" % (opts.app_label, codename))\n    return super().has_change_permission(request, obj)\n\ndef has_delete_permission(self, request, obj=None):\n    from django.contrib.auth import get_permission_codename\n    \n    parent_model = self._get_parent_model_from_through_model()\n    if parent_model:\n        opts = parent_model._meta\n        codename = get_permission_codename('delete', opts)\n        return request.user.has_perm(\"%s.%s\" % (opts.app_label, codename))\n    return super().has_delete_permission(request, obj)\n```\n\n## How It Works\n1. The helper method `_get_parent_model_from_through_model()` identifies if the inline is for an auto-created through model\n2. For through models, permission checks are performed against the parent model instead of the through model\n3. This ensures that users with only view permission on the parent model cannot edit the ManyToManyField inline\n\n## Testing\nTo verify the fix works:\n1. Create models with a ManyToManyField and corresponding admin inline\n2. Create a user with only view permissions on the parent model\n3. Verify that `has_add_permission`, `has_change_permission`, and `has_delete_permission` all return `False` for this user\n\nThis fix addresses the specific regression described in the GitHub issue while maintaining backward compatibility for other inline types."

Add a helper method to identify auto-created through models\n2. Modify has_add_permission(), has_change_permission(), and has_delete_permission() methods\n3. Check permissions on the parent model instead of the through model for ManyToManyField inlines\n4. Ensure view-only users cannot edit ManyToManyField inlines\n\nThis addresses the regression where users with only view permission could add/remove items from ManyToManyField inlines."
