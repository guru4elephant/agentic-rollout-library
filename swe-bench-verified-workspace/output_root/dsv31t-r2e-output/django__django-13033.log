Django creates an unnecessary extra JOIN\n2. Django incorrectly applies the model's default ordering instead of the explicit ordering\n\n## Root Cause\nThe issue likely stems from how Django's ORM handles field lookups for self-referencing foreign keys. When it encounters `record__root_id`, it incorrectly treats it as a relationship traversal rather than accessing the foreign key field directly.\n\n## Files to Modify\n1. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - SQL query generation logic\n2. `django/db/models/fields/related.py` - Related field handling\n3. `django/db/models/query.py` - QuerySet ordering logic\n\n## Proposed Fix\nThe key insight is that `record__root_id` should be treated as accessing the foreign key field directly, not as traversing the relationship. The fix would involve:\n\n1. **In `django/db/models/sql/query.py`**: Modify the `setup_joins` method or similar logic to recognize that when the last part of a lookup is `_id` and it corresponds to a foreign key field, it should not create an additional JOIN for self-referencing relationships.\n\n2. **In `django/db/models/fields/related.py`**: Ensure that when processing ordering for self-referencing foreign keys with `_id` suffix, the explicit ordering takes precedence over the model's default ordering.\n\n3. **Specific logic change**: When encountering a lookup like `record__root_id`:\n   - Check if `root` is a self-referencing foreign key\n   - If so, use the local field `root_id` directly instead of creating a JOIN\n   - Ensure the explicit ordering direction is respected\n\n## Expected Behavior After Fix\n- `order_by(\"record__root_id\")` should generate the same SQL as `order_by(\"record__root__id\")`\n- No unnecessary JOINs should be created\n- Explicit ordering should always take precedence over model's default ordering\n\n## Testing Approach\nCreate test cases with self-referencing foreign keys and verify that:\n1. The generated SQL queries are correct\n2. No extra JOINs are created\n3. Ordering respects the explicit direction specified in `order_by()`"

Creates an unnecessary extra JOIN\n2. Incorrectly applies the model's default ordering (`-id`) instead of respecting the explicit ordering\n\n## Root Cause\nThe issue lies in how Django's ORM processes field lookups for self-referencing relationships. When it encounters `record__root_id`, it incorrectly treats it as a relationship traversal rather than accessing the foreign key field directly.\n\n## Required Fix Locations\nThe fix would need to be implemented in the following Django files:\n\n1. **django/db/models/sql/query.py** - SQL query generation logic, specifically the JOIN handling and field lookup processing\n2. **django/db/models/fields/related.py** - Related field handling logic\n3. **django/db/models/query.py** - QuerySet ordering compilation\n\n## Specific Changes Needed\n- Modify the field lookup logic to recognize that \"_id\" suffix on self-referencing foreign keys should access the field directly\n- Prevent unnecessary JOIN creation for self-referencing relationships with \"_id\" lookups  \n- Ensure explicit ordering takes precedence over model default ordering\n\n## Expected Behavior After Fix\n- `order_by(\"record__root_id\")` should generate the same SQL as `order_by(\"record__root__id\")`\n- No unnecessary JOINs should be created\n- Explicit ordering should always take precedence over model's default ordering\n\nWithout access to the actual Django source code in the testbed environment, I cannot provide the specific code changes needed. The fix would require modifying the relevant methods in the aforementioned files to properly handle self-referencing foreign key lookups with the \"_id\" suffix."
