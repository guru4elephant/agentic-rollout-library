{"role": "user", "content": "Consider the following github issue:\n<github_issue>\nSet default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.\nDescription\n\t\nHello,\nAs far as I can see, the ​File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.\nWhat I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).\nThe tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementation of Python's built-in tempfile module explicitly sets such permissions for temporary files due to security considerations.\nI found mentions of this issue ​on GitHub, but did not manage to find any existing bug report in Django's bug tracker.\n\n</github_issue>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository to fix the <github_issue>?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <github_issue>.

As a first step, it might be a good idea to explore the repo to familiarize yourself with its structure.\n2. Create a script ('reproduce_issue.py') to reproduce the error and execute it to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\n6. When viewing large files, use specific line-ranges, usually within 50 to 100 lines) as required\n7. NOTE: The repository is at '/testbed' and the current working directory is already '/testbed', so DO NOT include 'testbed/' or 'testbed.' in relative paths in bash commands or reproduction python files.\n8. Use pip source http://pip.baidu.com/pypi/simple if you need to install new package with python\n"}
