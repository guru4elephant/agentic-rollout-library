Calling LLM...
LLM Response:       It seems there's an issue with the environment. Let me try to check if we're in the right directory and see what's available:

=== Iteration 6/50 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: There seems to be an issue with the tool wrapper. Let me try to restart or check if there's a different way to access the system. Let me try the search function to see if it works:

<function=search>

=== Iteration 7/50 ===
Calling LLM...
LLM Response: It appears all the functions are failing. This suggests there might be an issue with the environment setup. Let me try to submit this issue so it can be addressed:

Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "The tool functions are not working properly. All function calls are returning empty responses with exit code 1.
