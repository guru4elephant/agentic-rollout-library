The error \"ORDER BY position 4 is not in select list\" indicates an SQL generation issue where the ORDER BY clause references a column position that doesn't exist in the SELECT list of derived querysets.\n\nThe fix would likely involve modifying the Django ORM's SQL compiler to properly handle ORDER BY clauses when creating derived querysets from union operations. Specifically, the code in `/testbed/django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` and union-related code in `/testbed/django/db/models/query.py` would need to be examined and modified to ensure proper column reference handling.\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot provide the specific code changes due to environmental constraints preventing file access and exploration."
