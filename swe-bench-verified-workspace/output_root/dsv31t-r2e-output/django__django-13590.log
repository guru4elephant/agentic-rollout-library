Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "Successfully fixed the issue with named tuples used as arguments to __range filters in Django 3.0.\n\nThe problem was in `/testbed/django/db/models/sql/query.py` in the `resolve_lookup_value` method. When reconstructing sequences after resolving lookup values, the code was passing a generator expression directly to the type constructor (`type(value)(generator)`). This works for regular tuples and lists but fails for named tuples which expect individual positional arguments.\n\nThe fix changes the code to:\n1. First resolve all values into a list\n2. Then unpack the list when calling the constructor using `type(value)(*resolved_values)`\n\nThis ensures that named tuples (and other sequence types that require unpacking) work correctly while maintaining backward compatibility with regular tuples and other sequence types."
