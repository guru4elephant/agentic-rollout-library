This might involve:\n   - Adding UUID detection and conversion in the prefetch processing code\n   - Ensuring the conversion happens before object matching during prefetch\n\n5. **Test the fix**: Verify that the fix works with the reproduction script and doesn't break existing functionality.\n\nPlease check the environment setup and ensure the testbed directory contains the Django source code and that the functions are working properly before proceeding."
