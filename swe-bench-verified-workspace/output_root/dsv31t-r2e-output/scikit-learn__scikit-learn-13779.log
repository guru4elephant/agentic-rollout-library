When an estimator is set to None and sample weights are passed during fit, the code doesn't properly handle the None estimator and tries to call fit on it.\n\nThe fix would likely involve modifying the VotingClassifier's fit method to:\n1. Check if an estimator is None before trying to fit it\n2. Skip fitting None estimators but still handle the sample weights properly for the remaining estimators\n\nHowever, without access to the repository structure and the ability to explore the code, I cannot provide the specific implementation.
