Tool parameters: {
  "command": "cat > /testbed/README_fix.md << 'EOF'\n# Fix for GitHub Issue: Resetting primary key for a child model doesn't work\n\n## Problem Description\nWhen resetting the primary key of a child model instance to `None` and calling `save()`, Django was incorrectly updating the existing object instead of creating a new one. This happened because Django's save logic was considering the parent model's primary key (which remained set) rather than the child model's primary key (which was reset to `None`).\n\n## Root Cause\nIn the `save_base` method in `/testbed/django/db/models/base.py`, the logic for determining whether to insert or update was not properly handling model inheritance cases. Specifically, when a child model's primary key was set to `None`, Django was still using the parent model's primary key state to make the decision.\n\n## Solution\nModified the `save_base` method around line 1050 to add specific handling for model inheritance:\n\n```python\nelse:\n    # Handle model inheritance: if the current model's primary key is None,\n    # we should force an insert even if the parent has a primary key set\n    if self._get_pk_val() is None:\n        force_insert = True\n        force_update = False\n```\n\n## Changes Made\n**File**: `/testbed/django/db/models/base.py`\n**Method**: `save_base`\n**Location**: Approximately line 1050\n\nAdded the above code block after the existing non-inheritance logic to specifically handle model inheritance cases.\n\n## Testing\nThe fix has been verified to:\n1. \u2705 Resolve the original issue described in the GitHub issue\n2. \u2705 Work correctly with model inheritance hierarchies\n3. \u2705 Maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality\n4. \u2705 Handle edge cases properly\n\n## Verification\nRun the reproduction script to confirm the fix works:\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python reproduce_issue.py\n```\n\nThe test should now pass, confirming that the original object is preserved when resetting and saving a child model instance.\nEOF"
