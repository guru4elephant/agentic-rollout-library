  "command": "submit",
  "result": "Successfully fixed the issue with regex special characters in formset prefix causing potential data loss in admin changeform view.\n\nThe fix was implemented in `/testbed/django/contrib/admin/options.py` at line 1634 by adding `re.escape()` around the `prefix` variable when creating the regex pattern:\n\n**Before:**\n```python\npk_pattern = re.compile(r'{}-\\\\d+-{}$'.format(prefix, self.model._meta.pk.name))\n```\n\n**After:**\n```python\npk_pattern = re.compile(r'{}-\\\\d+-{}$'.format(re.escape(prefix), self.model._meta.pk.name))\n```\n\nThe fix ensures that when formset prefixes contain regex special characters (like brackets, dots, asterisks, etc.), they are properly escaped so the regex pattern compilation and matching work correctly. This prevents potential data loss in the admin changeform view by ensuring all formset fields are properly identified and processed.\n\nThe change is minimal and targeted, addressing exactly the security issue described in the GitHub issue without affecting any other functionality."
