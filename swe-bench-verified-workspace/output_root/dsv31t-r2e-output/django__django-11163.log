The problematic line that needs to be changed is:\n\nCurrent (incorrect):\n```python\nif fields and f.name not in fields:\n```\n\nShould be changed to:\n```python\nif fields is not None and f.name not in fields:\n```\n\nThis change ensures that when fields=[] (empty list) is passed, the function correctly returns an empty dictionary instead of returning all fields. The current code incorrectly treats an empty list as falsy, causing it to skip the field filtering logic."
