The issue occurs when comparing an UnrecognizedUnit instance with `None`.\n\nThe current code in the `__eq__` method tries to convert `other` to a Unit with `parse_strict='silent'`, but when `other` is `None`, this raises a TypeError because `None` is not a valid unit.\n\nThe fix should handle the case where `other` is `None` by returning `False` directly, since `None` cannot be equal to any Unit object.\n\nHere's what the fix should look like:\n\n```python\ndef __eq__(self, other):\n    if other is None:\n        return False\n    other = Unit(other, parse_strict='silent')\n    return isinstance(other, UnrecognizedUnit) and self.name == other.name\n```\n\nThis change adds a check for `None` before attempting to convert `other` to a Unit, preventing the TypeError.\n\nIf you can resolve the environment issue, I would be happy to help implement this fix properly."
