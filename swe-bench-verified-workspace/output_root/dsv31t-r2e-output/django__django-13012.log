I'm unable to:\n1. View files or directories\n2. Execute bash commands\n3. Search for content\n4. Create reproduction scripts\n\nWithout access to the Django codebase and the ability to reproduce the issue, I cannot implement the necessary changes to fix the ExpressionWrapper GROUP BY clause problem described in the GitHub issue.\n\nPlease check the testbed environment setup and ensure that:\n- The /testbed directory exists and contains the Django source code\n- The bash environment is properly configured\n- File access permissions are set correctly\n- Python and Django are properly installed\n\nOnce the environment issues are resolved, I'll be able to proceed with:\n1. Exploring the repository structure\n2. Creating a reproduction script\n3. Identifying the root cause in Django's query/expression handling\n4. Implementing the fix for ExpressionWrapper constant expressions in GROUP BY clauses\n5. Testing the fix"
