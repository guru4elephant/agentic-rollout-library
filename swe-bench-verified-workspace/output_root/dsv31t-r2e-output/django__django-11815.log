Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "I have successfully fixed the GitHub issue where migrations were using Enum values instead of names. The fix was implemented in `/testbed/django/db/migrations/serializer.py` by modifying the `EnumSerializer.serialize()` method to use the Enum's name with bracket notation (`Status['GOOD']`) instead of the value with parentheses (`Status('Good')`).\n\nThis change ensures migrations work correctly even when Enum values are translated, as they now reference the stable Enum names rather than translatable values. The fix has been thoroughly tested and all existing functionality continues to work correctly."
