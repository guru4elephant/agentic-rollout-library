     5	.. currentmodule:: django.forms
     6	
     7	.. admonition:: About this document
     8	
     9	    This document provides an introduction to the basics of web forms and how
    10	    they are handled in Django. For a more detailed look at specific areas of
    11	    the forms API, see :doc:`/ref/forms/api`, :doc:`/ref/forms/fields`, and
    12	    :doc:`/ref/forms/validation`.
    13	
    14	Unless you're planning to build websites and applications that do nothing but
    15	publish content, and don't accept input from your visitors, you're going to
    16	need to understand and use forms.
    17	
    18	Django provides a range of tools and libraries to help you build forms to
    19	accept input from site visitors, and then process and respond to the input.
    20	
    21	HTML forms
    22	==========
    23	
    24	In HTML, a form is a collection of elements inside ``<form>...</form>`` that
    25	allow a visitor to do things like enter text, select options, manipulate
    26	objects or controls, and so on, and then send that information back to the
    27	server.
    28	
    29	Some of these form interface elements - text input or checkboxes - are built
    30	into HTML itself. Others are much more complex; an interface that pops up a
    31	date picker or allows you to move a slider or manipulate controls will
    32	typically use JavaScript and CSS as well as HTML form ``<input>`` elements to
    33	achieve these effects.
    34	
    35	As well as its ``<input>`` elements, a form must specify two things:
    36	
    37	* *where*: the URL to which the data corresponding to the user's input should
    38	  be returned
    39	
    40	* *how*: the HTTP method the data should be returned by
    41	
    42	As an example, the login form for the Django admin contains several
    43	``<input>`` elements: one of ``type="text"`` for the username, one of
    44	``type="password"`` for the password, and one of ``type="submit"`` for the
    45	"Log in" button. It also contains some hidden text fields that the user
    46	doesn't see, which Django uses to determine what to do next.
    47	
    48	It also tells the browser that the form data should be sent to the URL
    49	specified in the ``<form>``â€™s ``action`` attribute - ``/admin/`` - and that it
    50	should be sent using the HTTP mechanism specified by the ``method`` attribute -

     2	Formsets
     3	========
     4	
     5	.. currentmodule:: django.forms.formsets
     6	
     7	.. class:: BaseFormSet
     8	
     9	A formset is a layer of abstraction to work with multiple forms on the same
    10	page. It can be best compared to a data grid. Let's say you have the following
    11	form::
    12	
    13	    >>> from django import forms
    14	    >>> class ArticleForm(forms.Form):
    15	    ...     title = forms.CharField()
    16	    ...     pub_date = forms.DateField()
    17	
    18	You might want to allow the user to create several articles at once. To create
    19	a formset out of an ``ArticleForm`` you would do::
    20	
    21	    >>> from django.forms import formset_factory
    22	    >>> ArticleFormSet = formset_factory(ArticleForm)
    23	
    24	You now have created a formset class named ``ArticleFormSet``.
    25	Instantiating the formset gives you the ability to iterate over the forms
    26	in the formset and display them as you would with a regular form::
    27	
    28	    >>> formset = ArticleFormSet()
    29	    >>> for form in formset:
    30	    ...     print(form.as_table())
    31	    <tr><th><label for="id_form-0-title">Title:</label></th><td><input type="text" name="form-0-title" id="id_form-0-title"></td></tr>
    32	    <tr><th><label for="id_form-0-pub_date">Pub date:</label></th><td><input type="text" name="form-0-pub_date" id="id_form-0-pub_date"></td></tr>
    33	
    34	As you can see it only displayed one empty form. The number of empty forms
    35	that is displayed is controlled by the ``extra`` parameter. By default,
    36	:func:`~django.forms.formsets.formset_factory` defines one extra form; the
    37	following example will create a formset class to display two blank forms::
    38	
    39	    >>> ArticleFormSet = formset_factory(ArticleForm, extra=2)
    40	
    41	Iterating over a formset will render the forms in the order they were
    42	created. You can change this order by providing an alternate implementation for
    43	the ``__iter__()`` method.
    44	
    45	Formsets can also be indexed into, which returns the corresponding form. If you
    46	override ``__iter__``, you will need to also override ``__getitem__`` to have
    47	matching behavior.

}
Tool execution status: success
Tool stdout:
Here's the result of running `cat -n` on /testbed/docs/topics/forms/formsets.txt:
   200	Just like when using a normal ``Form``, each field in a formset's forms may
   201	include HTML attributes such as ``maxlength`` for browser validation. However,
   202	form fields of formsets won't include the ``required`` attribute as that
   203	validation may be incorrect when adding and deleting forms.
   204	
   205	.. method:: BaseFormSet.total_error_count()
   206	
   207	To check how many errors there are in the formset, we can use the
   208	``total_error_count`` method::
   209	
   210	    >>> # Using the previous example
   211	    >>> formset.errors
   212	    [{}, {'pub_date': ['This field is required.']}]
   213	    >>> len(formset.errors)
   214	    2
   215	    >>> formset.total_error_count()
   216	    1
   217	
   218	We can also check if form data differs from the initial data (i.e. the form was
   219	sent without any data)::
   220	
   221	    >>> data = {
   222	    ...     'form-TOTAL_FORMS': '1',
   223	    ...     'form-INITIAL_FORMS': '0',
   224	    ...     'form-0-title': '',
   225	    ...     'form-0-pub_date': '',
   226	    ... }
   227	    >>> formset = ArticleFormSet(data)
   228	    >>> formset.has_changed()
   229	    False
   230	
   231	.. _understanding-the-managementform:
   232	
   233	Understanding the ``ManagementForm``
   234	------------------------------------
   235	
   236	You may have noticed the additional data (``form-TOTAL_FORMS``,
   237	``form-INITIAL_FORMS``) that was required in the formset's data above. This
   238	data is required for the ``ManagementForm``. This form is used by the formset
   239	to manage the collection of forms contained in the formset. If you don't
   240	provide this management data, the formset will be invalid::
   241	
   242	    >>> data = {
   243	    ...     'form-0-title': 'Test',
   244	    ...     'form-0-pub_date': '',
   245	    ... }
   246	    >>> formset = ArticleFormSet(data)
   247	    >>> formset.is_valid()
   248	    False
   249	
   250	It is used to keep track of how many form instances are being displayed. If
   251	you are adding new forms via JavaScript, you should increment the count fields
   252	in this form as well. On the other hand, if you are using JavaScript to allow
   253	deletion of existing objects, then you need to ensure the ones being removed
   254	are properly marked for deletion by including ``form-#-DELETE`` in the ``POST``
   255	data. It is expected that all forms are present in the ``POST`` data regardless.
   256	
   257	The management form is available as an attribute of the formset
   258	itself. When rendering a formset in a template, you can include all
   259	the management data by rendering ``{{ my_formset.management_form }}``
   260	(substituting the name of your formset as appropriate).
   261	
   262	.. note::
   263	
   264	    As well as the ``form-TOTAL_FORMS`` and ``form-INITIAL_FORMS`` fields shown
   265	    in the examples here, the management form also includes
   266	    ``form-MIN_NUM_FORMS`` and ``form-MAX_NUM_FORMS`` fields. They are output
   267	    with the rest of the management form, but only for the convenience of
   268	    client-side code. These fields are not required and so are not shown in
   269	    the example ``POST`` data.
   270	
   271	.. versionchanged:: 3.2
   272	
   273	    ``formset.is_valid()`` now returns ``False`` rather than raising an
   274	    exception when the management form is missing or has been tampered with.
   275	
   276	``total_form_count`` and ``initial_form_count``
   277	-----------------------------------------------
   278	
   279	``BaseFormSet`` has a couple of methods that are closely related to the
   280	``ManagementForm``, ``total_form_count`` and ``initial_form_count``.
   281	
   282	``total_form_count`` returns the total number of forms in this formset.
   283	``initial_form_count`` returns the number of forms in the formset that were
   284	pre-filled, and is also used to determine how many forms are required. You
   285	will probably never need to override either of these methods, so please be
   286	sure you understand what they do before doing so.
   287	
   288	.. _empty_form:
   289	
   290	``empty_form``
   291	--------------
   292	
   293	``BaseFormSet`` provides an additional attribute ``empty_form`` which returns
   294	a form instance with a prefix of ``__prefix__`` for easier use in dynamic
   295	forms with JavaScript.
   296	
   297	``error_messages``
   298	------------------

<<<Finished>>>
Final result: Successfully implemented the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets. Changes made:

1. **Modified `/testbed/django/forms/formsets.py`** (line ~386):
   - Changed `self._non_form_errors = self.error_class()` to `self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(error_class='nonform')`
   - This ensures non-form errors in FormSets get the `nonform` CSS class when rendered as HTML

2. **Updated `/testbed/docs/topics/forms/formsets.txt`** (around line 430):
   - Added documentation explaining that non-form errors are wrapped in a `<ul>` with CSS class `nonform`
   - This matches the documentation pattern used for forms' `nonfield` CSS class

The implementation:
- Follows Django's existing patterns exactly
- Maintains full backward compatibility
- Passes all existing tests
- Allows developers to style non-form errors differently from form-specific errors

The fix has been tested and confirmed to work correctly:
