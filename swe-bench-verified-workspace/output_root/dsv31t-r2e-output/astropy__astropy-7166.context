If path is a directory, view lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep\n  •    The create command cannot be used if the specified path already exists as a file\n  •    If a command generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with <response clipped>\n  •    The undo_edit command will revert the last edit made to the file at path\n\nNotes for using the str_replace command:\n  •    The old_str parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces!\n  •    If the old_str parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in old_str to make it unique\n  •    The new_str parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the old_str\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nAllowed values: [view, create, str_replace, insert, undo_edit]\nThe command to run.\n  2.    path (string, required)\nAbsolute path to file or directory, e.g. /testbed/file.py or /testbed.\n  3.    file_text (string, optional)\nRequired for the create command. Contains the content of the file to be created.\n  4.    old_str (string, optional)\nRequired for the str_replace command. The exact string in path to replace.\n  5.    new_str (string, optional)\n  •    Optional for the str_replace command to specify the replacement string.\n  •    Required for the insert command to specify the string to insert.\n  6.    insert_line (integer, optional)\nRequired for the insert command. The new_str will be inserted after the line number specified here.\n  7.    view_range (array, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command (when path is a file).\n  •    If provided, specifies the line range to view, e.g. [11, 12] shows lines 11 and 12.\n  •    [start_line, -1] will show all lines from start_line to the end of file.\n  8.    concise (boolean, optional)\n  •    Optional for the view command.\n  •    Defaults to True; displays a concise skeletal view of the file. If set to False, displays the full content in the specified view_range.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #1 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #2: execute_bash ––\nDescription:\nExecute a bash command in the terminal.\n\nBehavior notes:\n  •    If a command may run indefinitely (long-running), consider running it in the background and redirecting output, e.g. python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &.\n  •    If the bash command returns exit code -1, it means the process is still running. The assistant may:\n  •    Call this function again with command as an empty string (\"\") to retrieve additional logs.\n  •    Send more input to STDIN of the running process by calling this function again with command set to the text input.\n  •    Send command=\"ctrl+c\" to interrupt the currently running process.\n  •    If the command times out, it will be interrupted (SIGINT). The assistant may then retry or do further steps if needed.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nThe bash command (and optional arguments) to execute.\n  •    Can be empty (\"\") to retrieve more logs if the process is still running.\n  •    Can be \"ctrl+c\" to interrupt the running process.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #2 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #3: search ––\nDescription:\nSearch for a term in a directory or a single file.\n  •    If path is a directory (or unspecified, default is .), it recursively searches all non-hidden files and directories for the search term.\n  •    If path points to a file, it runs a grep -n in that file to show line numbers matching the search term.\n  •    If more than 100 files match in a directory search, results are truncated and the tool will inform you to narrow your search.\n  •    If no matches are found, it will inform you as well.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    search_term (string, required)\nThe term or string to search for in files.\n  2.    path (string, optional)\nThe file or directory to search in. Defaults to . if not specified.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #3 ––\n\n–– BEGIN FUNCTION #4: finish ––\nDescription:\nFinish the interaction once the task is complete or if no further progress can be made.\n\nBehavior notes:\n  •    The submit command finalizes your output.\n\nParameters:\n  1.    command (string, required)\nCurrently allowed value: [submit]\n  2.    result (string, optional)\nThe result text or final message to submit. Defaults to an empty string if not provided.\n\n–– END FUNCTION #4 ––\n\nIf you choose to call a function ONLY reply in the following format with NO suffix:\n\n<function=example_function_name>\n<parameter=example_parameter_1>value_1</parameter>\n<parameter=example_parameter_2>\nThis is the value for the second parameter\nthat can span\nmultiple lines\n</parameter>\n</function>\n\n<IMPORTANT>\nReminder:\n- Function calls MUST follow the specified format, start with <function= and end with </function>\n- Required parameters MUST be specified\n- Only call one function at a time\n- VERY IMPORTANT: Each response must include both reasoning (as natural text) and function call (in above format) to solve the task.\n\n- Focus on the specific issue described\n- Make minimal changes to fix the issue\n- Ensure your changes don't break existing functionality"}

This suggests there may be an issue with the testbed environment setup or the function wrappers. \n\nSince I cannot proceed with the standard approach, let me try to understand the issue conceptually based on the GitHub issue description and provide a general solution approach.\n\nThe issue states that the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass doesn't work for properties because it uses `inspect.isfunction` which returns `False` for properties. \n\n**Expected Solution Approach:**\n1. Locate the `InheritDocstrings` metaclass in the codebase\n2. Find where `inspect.isfunction` is used to check class members\n3. Modify the logic to also handle properties using `inspect.isdatadescriptor` or `hasattr(obj, 'fget')` to identify properties\n4. Ensure the docstring inheritance works for both methods and properties\n\n**Typical fix would involve:**\n- Changing from `inspect.isfunction(member)` to something like:\n  ```python\n  if inspect.isfunction(member) or isinstance(member, property):\n  ```\n- Or using a more comprehensive check that handles both functions and properties\n\nHowever, without access to the actual codebase to examine the specific implementation and test the fix, I cannot provide the exact code changes needed.\n\n<function=finish>\n<parameter=command>submit</parameter>\n<parameter=result>Unable to proceed due to technical issues with the environment functions.
