Access to the Django source code in /testbed to examine the models/fields implementation\n2. Ability to create reproduction scripts to confirm the issue\n3. Access to modify the relevant Django source files\n\nThe issue describes a problem where when using TextChoices/IntegerChoices enums as field choices, the value returned from a model instance field getter is the enum member itself rather than the underlying string/integer value. This causes inconsistencies between freshly created instances and retrieved instances.\n\nWithout access to the environment, I cannot proceed with the analysis and fix. Please ensure the testbed environment is properly configured and accessible, then I'll be able to:\n1. Explore the Django source code structure\n2. Create a reproduction script\n3.
