Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "Fixed the FileField callable storage deconstruction issue by modifying the deconstruct method in /testbed/django/db/models/fields/files.py.\n\nThe change adds a check if not callable(self.storage): before adding the storage to kwargs, ensuring that callable storage parameters are preserved as callables during deconstruction, just like the upload_to parameter already does.\n\nThis fixes the issue where callable storage was being evaluated during migration generation, breaking the ability to select different storages at runtime."

Executing tool: r2e_submit
Tool parameters: {
  "command": "submit",
  "result": "Successfully fixed the FileField callable storage deconstruction issue. The change was made to `/testbed/django/db/models/fields/files.py` in the `deconstruct` method by adding a check `if not callable(self.storage):` before adding the storage to kwargs. This ensures callable storage parameters are preserved as callables during deconstruction, maintaining runtime storage selection capability."
